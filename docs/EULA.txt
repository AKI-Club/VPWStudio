VPW Studio End User License Agreement

By downloading and using this program, you accept the following terms:

- You will not contact me (freem) *privately* for technical support regarding
this program. This includes, but is not limited to, e-mails, private messages,
smoke signals, pigeongrams, Marconi devices, etc.

It is important to note that you are able to ask questions in *public* spaces,
such as (but not limited to):
 - the Discussions page on GitHub | https://github.com/AKI-Club/VPWStudio/discussions
 - the VPW2 freem Edition Discord
 - AKI Live messageboard  | https://akilive.boards.net/
 - VPW2 Dojo messageboard | https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/vpw2dojo/

This is so other people can learn from your questions, and also so I don't have
to repeat myself (as much).

(Yes, I know that Discord is not really a viable solution for long-term information
storage.)

- You will make a best faith attempt to read and understand the included documentation.
If the documentation is lacking, that's on me, not you.

That's it.
