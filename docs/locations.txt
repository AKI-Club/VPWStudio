"Locations" refers to multiple places:
* ROM locations (in which case we assume Z64 format)
* RAM locations (used with GameShark codes)

Each game has different locations for the same items.
It would be much better to allow the program to load these locations from
external files, instead of being hardcoded.

Thus, I need to come up with a parsable format for this bullshit.

type:location,length,comment

RAM:8006966A,4;pointer to X
ROM:209270,2;Beginning of ID2 values for AJPW2

RAM type = GameShark codes
ROM type = ROM hacks

All locations are read as hex.
RAM addresses must be 8 digits, and start with 8.
ROM locations are assumed for Z64 format, as mentioned above.

valid lengths are anything greater than 0.

comments go to the end of the line, \n terminated.
this way, they should work on all platforms that matter?
