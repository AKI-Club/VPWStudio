VPW Studio Changelog
====================
All dates are year/month/day format.

Pre-Alpha Preview 16 (202x/yy/zz)
---------------------------------
I'm working on it, but now I have some friends who might help?

Pre-Alpha Preview 15 (2021/08/25)
---------------------------------
* Target .NET Framework version changed from 4.6.1 to 4.7.2.

* Replaced SharpDX with OpenTK.
  Please delete any SharpDX .dll files in the VPW Studio program directory.
  Specifically, these files are no longer necessary:
  - SharpDX.D3DCompiler.dll
  - SharpDX.Desktop.dll
  - SharpDX.Direct3D11.dll
  - SharpDX.dll
  - SharpDX.DXGI.dll
  - SharpDX.Mathematics.dll

* [AkiModel] Fixed vertical texture map offsets in Wavefront OBJ export.

* Removed incomplete GameShark Tool.
  It will be replaced with a stand-alone tool, available sometime in the future.
  Hopefully.

* [No Mercy Wrestler Editor] Allow the use of an edited AkiText for Profile data.

* Renamed NoMercyText to MenuItems_NoGroup and added an editor for it.

* [No Mercy Costume Editor] Properly save changes, added missing items, and made
  remaining options editable.

* [Project Settings] Removed ability to set Game/Product Code, as emulators and
  flashcarts use this to determine what save data type is required. You can still
  set the region code, though.
  (Filing this under "things I had to learn the hard way, so you don't have to".)

* Rearranged Danger menu to put the most useful (read: PNG conversion) tools
  at the top.

* Added No Mercy MenuItems_Shop data editor.
  It's a bit cumbersome, as you have to press a "make changes" button for data
  to be written back. This will likely change in the future.

* [Project File] Allow relative path for the input/base ROM file.
  (This is only possible once the project file has been saved.)

* [Hex Viewer] Replaced ByteViewer control with Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox.
  Contents are still read-only, but can be selected and copied now.

* [Move Damage Test] Actually show values for WWF No Mercy.

* [File Table Dialog] Perform "does file exist?" checks for AkiText,
  MenuItems_NoGroup, and MenuItems_Shop filetypes.

* ModelTool2 dialog upgraded and slightly redesigned.
  Now features a static 3D preview, with the ability to load textures from ROM.

* Added TIM Tester (PS1 texture format) to Danger menu, as part of initial steps
  towards supporting the PS1 AKI wrestling games.

* As usual, there's a few FileTableDB updates.
  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 14 (2020/02/16)
---------------------------------
* [StoryMode_VPW2 "editor"] Display wrestler names next to ID2 values.

* [FileTable_EditEntryInfoDialog] Fixed issue with file types being wrongly assigned.
  (Yes, again.)

* [General] Fixed issue where current development versions of Project64 were
  treating the currently active directory in VPW Studio as the emulator's home
  directory. You would only run into this issue if the PJ64 directory settings
  were set to use "$AppPath", but better safe than sorry.

* [General] Opening a project via command line argument or drag and drop should now
  be a little more user-proof.
  (In other words, only open files with a ".vpwsproj" extension.)

* [Project Properties] Implemented changing the directory for Assets and
  Project File paths.

* [AkiArchive] Attempt to fix up certain archive entries.

* [AkiModel] Updated Wavefront OBJ export texture mapping handling.

* [Build Log Verbosity] Changed default value to "Normal" (was previously "Detailed").

* Hey, don't be surprised by this one, but randymanfoo provided even more
  FileTableDB updates for WWF No Mercy.
  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 13 (2019/09/25)
---------------------------------
Wow, that's a long time between updates.

* [CostumeDefs_Early] A few operational changes for consistency's sake:
  - Use hex numbers for Body Types list.
  - Show masked Body Type in the Costumes tab.

* [File Conversion] Fix VPWStudio Palette files not being accepted for CI8Palette conversion.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Fixed displayed weight values not being corrected.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Fixed issue where a weight value of 0 would not update the
  text display to the right.

* [CiPalette Editor] Now loads data from replacement file if set.

* [Program] New icon design.

* [AkiAnimation] Rotation changed to signed byte. (Makes sense, really)

* [ROM Build Process] Added support for Ci4Background conversion.

* [Ci4Palette, Ci8Palette] Preliminary support for Adobe ACT palette import.
  Does not support sub-palettes yet.

* [CiPaletteEditor] Allow importing Adobe ACT palettes.

* [FileTypes] Redid the logic that handles valid FileTypes for the specific games.

* [FileTable Dialogs] Fixed errors related to FileTypes not being properly set.

* More FileTableDB updates, including a large No Mercy update from randymanfoo.
  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 12 (2018/11/07)
---------------------------------
* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Height and Weight values can now be changed.
  (Data is not yet written back to ROM.)

* [VPW2 Costume Editor control] Fix error where Mask Head Shape was ignored.

* [FileTable] Fix issue related to ExtraData when creating a new project.

* [FileTable EditEntryInfo Dialog] Fix an issue related to ExtraData.

* [FileTable EditEntryInfo Dialog] Set Replacement File open dialog filter
  based on selected FileType option. Currently only works for CI4/CI8 palettes
  and CI4/CI8/AKI textures.

* [FileTable Editor] Search now reports when you've reached the last requested item.

* [FileTable EditMultiEntryInfoDialog] Set the unsaved changes flag if any changes
  are made. (It wasn't doing so previously.)

* [FileTableEntry ExtraData] Added Horizontal and Vertical Mirroring for textures.

* [FileTable EditMultiEntryInfoDialog] Fix an error related to erasing a file's
  replacement path.

* More FileTableDB updates. A few more entries have ExtraData. To update your
  project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database -> Reload File
  Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 11 (2018/10/16)
---------------------------------
* [FileTableDialog] Implement "Find Previous" via Shift+F3 keyboard shortcut.

* [FileTableDB] Added support for "Extra Data". This currently includes:
  - Image Width and Height (for I*Textures)
  - Intended Palette ID (for CI4 and CI8 textures)

* [FileTable_CiTexturePreviewDialog] Fix crash related to palette comments,
  or lack thereof.

* VPW2 Default Costume Editor added and implemented.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] A few updates regarding wrestler names:
  - Short names can now use data from replacement FileTable ID 006C.
  - Wrestler profile data now also uses data from replacement FileTable ID 006C.

* [VPW2 Stable Editor] Load custom group names from replacement FileTable ID 006C.

* [ROM Build Process] Fixed issue where relative Output ROM paths
  were seen as invalid during the directory check.

* FileTableDB updates again. This time, a number of entries have "Extra Data".
  This primarily concerns I4Textures, CI4Textures, and CI8Textures.

Pre-Alpha Preview 10 (2018/09/30)
---------------------------------
* Started work on VPW2 Story Mode/RRS Editor.

* Added the ability to override a FileType for a specified entry.
  Before this, reloading the FileTableDB comments would overwrite any changes
  you made for files that didn't match the FileTableDB's entry. Useful when
  replacing leftover files from previous games.

* [AkiTextEditor] Add information about the current file to the title bar.

* [Toki1 Test Tool] Added support for Revenge, WM2K, and No Mercy.
  World Tour and VPW64 have shorter Toki1 values and are not "officially"
  supported yet.

* [Hex Viewer] Added comment in title bar when loading file from FileTable.

* [Ci*Palette] Added support for exporting GIMP palette files.

* Started work on Move Damage tool (WM2K and VPW2 only for now).

* VERY LARGE update to FileTableDBs. All animation values should be marked, even
  if most don't have a comment attached. (WrestleMania 2000 NTSC-J has not been
  updated in this manner.) To update your project, open the File Table dialog,
  then choose Database -> Reload File Table Database.

  WrestleMania 2000 NTSC-J's Japanese messages are stored as AkiTextures.
  These entries have been marked (but not translated).

Pre-Alpha Preview 9 (2018/09/15)
--------------------------------
* [No Mercy Default Costume Editor] Fixed "Hairy 2" Body Type being listed as Female.

* [No Mercy Default Costume Editor] Ring Attire list updated with sections.

* Dragging and dropping a project file to open it now properly loads the
  Input ROM and LocationFile data.

* [WCW/nWo Revenge Wrestler Editor] Added string displays for Wrestler Name,
  Height, and Weight Pointers.

* Location file is re-loaded when changing an open project to a new game type.

* Valid menus are reset when changing an open project to a new game type.

* [CI Texture Previewer] Added ability to set preview image background color.

* [FileTypes] Added Ci4Background, used in WWF No Mercy for the Smackdown Mall
  background images. Currently read-only.

* [CI Texture Previewer] Allowed dialog to be resized.

* [Animation Tool] Add the ability to export animation values to the clipboard,
  for use with S.K. Stylez's Animation Editor spreadsheet.

* [FileTableDialog] Fix issue where reloading the FileTableDB multiple times
  would cause an error.

* [FileTableDialog] Added rudimentary Search and Find Next features.
  Still not perfect.

* [AkiArchiveTool] Suggest filenames for extracted files.

* [ROM Building] Build log now displays error messages in the following cases:
  - Unable to convert relative replacement path
  - Requested replacement file does not exist

* [ROM Building] Build log displays error messages for any files that were
  unable to be converted.

* Various updates to FileTableDBs, as usual. To update your project, open
  the File Table dialog, then choose Database -> Reload File Table Database.

  One note of importance with the FileTableDB update in Pre-Alpha Preview 9:
  All of the WrestleMania 2000 and No Mercy Titantron frames are now marked.

  Interestingly enough, Steve Blackman's Titantron in WM2K has four frames
  that appear to go unused. The sequence depicts a leg sweep from a different
  angle than the corresponding move in the version of his Titantron uploaded
  to YouTube.

  Another advancement of note is the beginning of documenting the Animation
  File IDs.

Pre-Alpha Preview 8 (2018/08/31)
--------------------------------
* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Height and Weight now show both hex and "real" values.
  The special values ("???") still need to be handled.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Fixed incorrect numbering of Voice B items.

* Implemented first version of WCW/nWo Revenge Championship Editor.

* [Project Properties] Disable "overwrite file?" prompt when setting the output
  ROM path to an existing file.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Added ability to view wrestler appearance data.
  (Currently uses a hex editor view; custom dialog to come later.)

* [No Mercy Wrestler Editor] Added ability to view wrestler appearance data.
  (Uses a custom dialog, unlike VPW2. It's easier when you only have to deal
  with one costume at a time versus four... The current design was quickly
  hacked together just to get something working.)

* [VPW2 Face Tester] Fixed tab order and added keyboard accelerators.

* [VPW2 Face Tester] Added workaround for a CI8 Front Hair texture.

* [AkiArchive Tool] Added ability to view TEX files and ITextures in archives.

* Various updates to FileTableDBs, as usual.

Pre-Alpha Preview 7 (2018/07/28)
--------------------------------
* [Main Form] Added ability to open Project Files by dragging and dropping.

* [WM2K Wrestler Editor] Added missing Costume Pointer text boxes.

* Added AKI Archive Tool, which replaces "Packed File Tool"/Tools -> Archive File.

* Started work on WCW/nWo Revenge Wrestler Editor.

* Various updates to FileTableDBs, as usual. To update your project, open
  the File Table dialog, then choose Database -> Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 6 (2018/07/17)
--------------------------------
* [FileTable editor] Implemented multiple raw file export.

* [FileTable editor] Implemented multi-select version of Edit Information dialog.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Quality of life improvements, including adding
  accelerators/keyboard shortcuts and wrestler short names next to the ID4
  in the list.

* [Project File, Project Properties] Added game region setting.

* [No Mercy Wrestler Editor] Same changes as VPW2 Wrestler Editor.

* [Project File] Added Stable Definition File path. This file is generated by
  the program after pressing OK in the Stable Editor.

* [VPW2 Stable Editor] Write out StableDefs.txt and set the Stable Definition
  File path in the ProjectFile if StableDefs.txt doesn't exist.

* No Mercy Stable Editor added. Acts the same as VPW2 Stable Editor.

* [ROM Building] Write Stable Definitions to ROM for WM2K, VPW2, and No Mercy.

* WM2K Stable Editor has been updated with the same functionality as VPW2 and No Mercy.

* [Internals] Added Hex Viewer Manager, allowing for multiple Hex Viewers to be opened.

* [Danger Zone] Added ROM slice test.

* Help -> Manual now shows the (very incomplete) manual.

* [FileTable Editor] Hex editor now works when selecting multiple items.

* Fixed a very bad bug that prevented showing the proper Project Property values
  when opening another project in the same session.

Pre-Alpha Preview 5 (2018/06/30)
--------------------------------
* No Mercy Default Costume Data class added.
  Thanks to jordyad for documenting the values. Nothing user-facing yet.

* CITexture and ITexture preview dialogs now include file comments
  in the title bar.

* The program will now attempt to report issues with the FileTableDB when
  reloading the Database.

* MenuBackground converter in the FileTable editor.
  Right click on the first file in a MenuBackground collection, choose
  "MenuBackground Replacement", and open a 320x240 16-color PNG file.
  This will automatically convert the image into the proper format, create
  a directory in ProjectFiles\Background\ named after the input filename,
  and update the Project FileTable with the relevant paths.

* If you want to convert a MenuBackground without needing a project open,
  there's a MenuBackground converter available in the Danger Zone.

* AkiText editor now includes a Control Codes reference.

* Various small changes that I haven't bothered documenting here.

* As usual, more entries are defined in the FileTableDB for some games.
  Both No Mercy and VPW2 have at least 250 new entries in their FileTableDBs.

Pre-Alpha Preview 4 (2018/05/23)
--------------------------------
* Font Dialog implemented.
  This replaces the font image export as the default Aki*Font handler in the
  FileTable editor. If an AkiFontChars file is not defined in the FileTable,
  a fallback character set will be used. This fallback set may not be accurate
  to what the font actually contains.

* Implemented VPW Studio Palette format.
  This is similar to the JASC Paint Shop Pro palette format, but it also
  supports alpha/transparency values and CI4 sub-palettes.

* Added Stable Editor for WrestleMania 2000.

* "Play ROM" will now build the ROM if it hasn't been built.
  This makes the "Build and Play ROM" option (mostly) redundant.

* AkiAnimation file type added, though not complete yet.
  However, you can view the Animation data... kind of.

* As usual, more entries are defined in the FileTableDB for some games.

Pre-Alpha Preview 3 (2018/04/23)
--------------------------------
* FileTable change support added for:
 * Virtual Pro-Wrestling 64
 * WCW vs. nWo World Tour (NTSC-U v1.1/Revision A)

* VPW2 Face Tester now handles item offsets properly, I think????

* Added AkiTextEditor. This replaces the two previous AkiText dialogs.
  Note: Importing from CSV does not work yet.

* Added "Build and Play" Project menu item (Shift+F5).

* Started working on the ModelTool2, which will eventually render 3D items.

* FileTable editor now allows you to use the Hex Editor for any item type.

Pre-Alpha Preview 2 (2018/04/15)
--------------------------------
* Now supports FileTable changes for the following games:
  - WCW/nWo Revenge (NTSC-U, PAL)
  - WWF WrestleMania 2000 (NTSC-U, NTSC-J, PAL)
  - WWF No Mercy (NTSC-U v1.0/v1.1, PAL v1.0/v1.1)

CI* Editor Improvements:
* Implemented CI4 sub-palette import/export.
* Allow for selection of sub-palettes.

* Added "Build Log Verbosity" option.

Pre-Alpha Preview 1 (2018/04/10)
--------------------------------
First release to testers.

Origin Point (2018/02/11)
-------------------------
Project begins.
