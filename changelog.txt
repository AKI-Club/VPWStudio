VPW Studio Changelog
====================
All dates are year/month/day format.

Pre-Alpha Preview 8 (2018/??/??)
--------------------------------
I'm working on it.

Pre-Alpha Preview 7 (2018/07/28)
--------------------------------
* [Main Form] Added ability to open Project Files by dragging and dropping.

* [WM2K Wrestler Editor] Added missing Costume Pointer text boxes.

* Added AKI Archive Tool, which replaces "Packed File Tool"/Tools -> Archive File.

* Started work on WCW/nWo Revenge Wrestler Editor.

* Various updates to FileTableDBs, as usual. To update your project, open
  the File Table dialog, then choose Database -> Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 6 (2018/07/17)
--------------------------------
* [FileTable editor] Implemented multiple raw file export.

* [FileTable editor] Implemented multi-select version of Edit Information dialog.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Quality of life improvements, including adding
  accelerators/keyboard shortcuts and wrestler short names next to the ID4
  in the list.

* [Project File, Project Properties] Added game region setting.

* [No Mercy Wrestler Editor] Same changes as VPW2 Wrestler Editor.

* [Project File] Added Stable Definition File path. This file is generated by
  the program after pressing OK in the Stable Editor.

* [VPW2 Stable Editor] Write out StableDefs.txt and set the Stable Definition
  File path in the ProjectFile if StableDefs.txt doesn't exist.

* No Mercy Stable Editor added. Acts the same as VPW2 Stable Editor.

* [ROM Building] Write Stable Definitions to ROM for WM2K, VPW2, and No Mercy.

* WM2K Stable Editor has been updated with the same functionality as VPW2 and No Mercy.

* [Internals] Added Hex Viewer Manager, allowing for multiple Hex Viewers to be opened.

* [Danger Zone] Added ROM slice test.

* Help -> Manual now shows the (very incomplete) manual.

* [FileTable Editor] Hex editor now works when selecting multiple items.

* Fixed a very bad bug that prevented showing the proper Project Property values
  when opening another project in the same session.

Pre-Alpha Preview 5 (2018/06/30)
--------------------------------
* No Mercy Default Costume Data class added.
  Thanks to jordyad for documenting the values. Nothing user-facing yet.

* CITexture and ITexture preview dialogs now include file comments
  in the title bar.

* The program will now attempt to report issues with the FileTableDB when
  reloading the Database.

* MenuBackground converter in the FileTable editor.
  Right click on the first file in a MenuBackground collection, choose
  "MenuBackground Replacement", and open a 320x240 16-color PNG file.
  This will automatically convert the image into the proper format, create
  a directory in ProjectFiles\Background\ named after the input filename,
  and update the Project FileTable with the relevant paths.

* If you want to convert a MenuBackground without needing a project open,
  there's a MenuBackground converter available in the Danger Zone.

* AkiText editor now includes a Control Codes reference.

* Various small changes that I haven't bothered documenting here.

* As usual, more entries are defined in the FileTableDB for some games.
  Both No Mercy and VPW2 have at least 250 new entries in their FileTableDBs.

Pre-Alpha Preview 4 (2018/05/23)
--------------------------------
* Font Dialog implemented.
  This replaces the font image export as the default Aki*Font handler in the
  FileTable editor. If an AkiFontChars file is not defined in the FileTable,
  a fallback character set will be used. This fallback set may not be accurate
  to what the font actually expects.

* Implemented VPW Studio Palette format.
  This is similar to the JASC Paint Shop Pro palette format, but it also
  supports alpha/transparency values and CI4 sub-palettes.

* Added Stable Editor for WrestleMania 2000.

* "Play ROM" will now build the ROM if it hasn't been built.
  This makes the "Build and Play ROM" option (mostly) redundant.

* AkiAnimation file type added, though not complete yet.
  However, you can view the Animation data... kind of.

* As usual, more entries are defined in the FileTableDB for some games.

Pre-Alpha Preview 3 (2018/04/23)
--------------------------------
* FileTable change support added for:
 * Virtual Pro-Wrestling 64
 * WCW vs. nWo World Tour (NTSC-U v1.1/Revision A)

* VPW2 Face Tester now handles item offsets properly, I think????

* Added AkiTextEditor. This replaces the two previous AkiText dialogs.
  Note: Importing from CSV does not work yet.

* Added "Build and Play" Project menu item (Shift+F5).

* Started working on the ModelTool2, which will eventually render 3D items.

* FileTable editor now allows you to use the Hex Editor for any item type.

Pre-Alpha Preview 2 (2018/04/15)
--------------------------------
* Now supports FileTable changes for the following games:
  - WCW/nWo Revenge (NTSC-U, PAL)
  - WWF WrestleMania 2000 (NTSC-U, NTSC-J, PAL)
  - WWF No Mercy (NTSC-U v1.0/v1.1, PAL v1.0/v1.1)

CI* Editor Improvements:
* Implemented CI4 sub-palette import/export.
* Allow for selection of sub-palettes.

* Added "Build Log Verbosity" option.

Pre-Alpha Preview 1 (2018/04/10)
