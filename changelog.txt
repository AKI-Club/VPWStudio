VPW Studio Changelog
====================
All dates are year/month/day format.

Pre-Alpha Preview 35 (202x/yy/zz)
---------------------------------
Currently being worked on...

Pre-Alpha Preview 34 (2024/05/06)
---------------------------------
- Added ArchiveFileDB, which documents the files in AkiArchives, similar to how
  the FileTableDB works. Only valid for WCW/nWo Revenge and later.

- [AkiArchive Viewer] Now displays File Type and Comment (if available) when
  selecting an item.

- [AkiArchive Viewer] Suggests a relevant file extension when exporting a file
  if the File Type is available.

- [Font Dialog] Added file offset for the selected character to the output textbox.

- [File Table Dialog] Renamed "Export Raw" to "Export LZSS".

- [File Table Dialog] Added PNG Export for AkiTexture files via context menu.

- [No Mercy Default Costume Editor] Fixed a bug regarding Left Elbowpad's values.

- [Game Intro "Editor"] Added status bar showing ROM locations of selected cells.

- [FileTableDB] Decently large update to VPW2 FileTableDB (as required for
  some other work I'm doing), and a smaller update to the WM2K FileTableDB.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose
  Database → Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 33 (2023/12/06)
---------------------------------
Some changes to internals are not listed here, since they're not end-user facing.

- Added WM2K support to Match Ruleset "editor".

- [VPW64 Default Costume Set Dialog] Added "press Escape key to close dialog" functionality.

- Added Revenge Default Costume Set Dialog in the Danger Zone.

- Renamed "vpw64 costume test" to "vpw64/revenge costume test" per the above.

- [No Mercy FileTableDBs] Labeled the 006A-area move name files as "(old)".
  They're leftovers, likely from when the menus more resembled VPW2/WM2K.

- Added preliminary support for No Mercy move name files.

- Added read-only support for Virtual Pro-Wrestling 64 game intro data.

- [FileTableDB] No Mercy's FileTableDB has been updated to mark the move name
  files properly. (The September 2000 pre-release is still incomplete in this
  regard.)

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose
  Database → Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 32 (2023/10/28)
---------------------------------
- [Font Dialog] Extended width of info textbox. Also made the info textbox's
  background color change to light blue if the generic fallback character set
  is being used.

- [Font Dialog] Allow viewing replacement font data.

- [Move Damage Test] Now works with World Tour, VPW64, and Revenge.
  Values are still unmarked, however.

- You can now click on the game's name on the right side of the statusbar to
  bring up the Project Properties dialog.

- [AkiTextEditor Go To Dialog] Fix issue with entering a larger value than
  the maximum.

- [AkiTextEditor Go To Dialog] Select the text on dialog open.

- [Danger Zone Text Index Tool] Now loads replacement AkiText if a path has been set.

- [Stable Definitions (Early) Dialog] Added "View Championships" button.

- [Championship Definitions (Early) Dialog] Added "Escape key closes dialog" functionality.

- [FileTableDB] World Tour and VPW64 are now 100% marked.
  No Mercy September 2000 pre-release has also been updated.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose
  Database → Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 31 (2023/09/25)
---------------------------------
- [Costume Color Control] Now supports VPW64 and Revenge colors.

- [RenderableN64, TestScene3D] Add CI8 texture/palette support.

- Added ChampionshipDefs_Early data viewer (for World Tour and VPW64).

- Added Tag Team data viewer for WM2K.

- [TestScene3D] Added custom mesh scaling.
  (Scale value from model data is currently ignored.)

- Disabled the incomplete VPW2 Costume dialog, since it was confusing people and
  needs a redesign anyways.

- [FileTable_EditEntryInfoDialog] Allow image width, image height, and intended
  palette to be un-set, in case you accidentally set them.

- [File Table Dialog] Added "Database -> FTDB Info..." option, mainly for internal use.

- [VPW2 Demo Match Dialog] Added wrestler names.

- [Game-Specific Docs] Add links to document archives for each game.

- [Param Unpack Test] Update/fix No Mercy bit widths.

- [Face Tester] Partial WM2K support (NTSC-J still needs fixing).

- [File Table Dialog] Fixed issue with MenuBackground replacement not changing
  modified file entries to have a red background.

- [FileTableDB] Large update for VPW64 (now at 99%), as well as updates for
  World Tour, Revenge, WM2000 NTSC-J, and No Mercy Sept. 2000 pre-release.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose
  Database -> Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 30 (2023/08/31)
---------------------------------
First public release, after many years of work.
No, it's still not done; I'm just sick of holding it back.

- [Move Damage Test Dialog] Now includes "0x" at beginning of all hex numbers.

- [Name Encode/Decode Tool] Added legend for special characters ("<>" and "{}").

- [VPW64 Costume Dialog] Fix various issues with costume type definitions.
  (No, not the one where a Ci8Texture is using a Ci4Palette.)

- [Intro Data "Editor"] Add note about changes not being saved when pressing "OK".

- [Project Files, FileTableDB] Add support for custom FileTableDBs.

- [Hex Viewer] Requesting an already open, yet minimized, hex viewer will un-minimize
  the hex viewer in question.

- [Text Index Tool] Add "Go To Entry" button, which opens an AkiTextEditor.
  (Only works with non-global entries. Edits not yet saved.)

- [Text Index Tool] Add WWF No Mercy support.
  (Pointer values are for NTSC-U v1.0; other region/revision support to-do)

- [No Mercy Default Costume Editor] Add copy/paste support.

- [Text Index Tool] Add WM2K support (all three regions).

- [VPW2 Default Costume Editor] Add copy/paste support.

- [File Table Dialog] Add FileTableDB format export.

- [FileTable_EditMultiEntryInfoDialog] A few changes under the hood:
  - Expanded default width to 800px (up from 720, which remains the minimum).
  - Re-configured default column widths.
  - Run AutoResizeColumns after the form loads.

- [FileTable_EditMultiEntryInfoDialog] Now remembers width of dialog, as long as
  the File Table Editor stays open.

- [Project Properties Dialog] Fix bug where Output ROM's "Browse" button would
  change the Base ROM's path when used.

- [FileTableDB] Lots of updates for World Tour and VPW64.
  A smaller amount of updates for WCW/nWo Revenge and No Mercy Sept. 2000 prerelease.
  Updated WM2K (NTSC/PAL), VPW2, and No Mercy to 100%.
  Fixed up some entries in the No Mercy FileTableDB as well.
  RetroRandy also sent over some No Mercy updates.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose
  Database -> Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 29 (2023/08/05)
---------------------------------
- [Game Intro Editor] Added "Reload ROM Data" button.
  Considering you currently need to make changes to the intro via hex editing,
  this button was sorely missing.

- [Font Dialog] Show the selected character's header bytes in a textbox.
  These bytes appear to modify character size and/or spacing in some form,
  but are still unknown.

- If a custom LocationFile is being used and the project's FileTable location
  doesn't match the value in the custom LocationFile, update the project.

- [Help] Added Shift+F1 shortcut to open Game-Specific Information.

- [AkiTextEditor] Added "Go To" option.

Pre-Alpha Preview 28 (2023/02/17)
---------------------------------
- Preliminary support for WWF No Mercy September 2000 prototype.
  Build/editing support is not planned for any prototype/pre-release versions.

- Ignore blank lines in FileTableDB files instead of erroring out.
  (I'm actually surprised I didn't run into this issue sooner...)

- [New Project Dialog] Add "built.z64" to the default Output ROM File box.

- [Toki 1 Test Dialog] Added labels for modern game offsets 0x08 and 0x10.
  Thanks to RetroRandy for figuring those out.
  (offset 0x10's purpose is only known for No Mercy right now;
  VPW2 and earlier still unknown.)

- [Toki 1 Test Dialog] Added hex values for Effect frame numbers.

- [Project Build] If the Output ROM Path directory does not exist, offer to
  create it.

- [FileTable Edit Entry Dialog] Fixed issue where certain file types would not
  use the proper file filter (e.g. CI8Texture brought up CI8Palette file types).

- [PNG Conversion Tools] Now shows a message box with the output file location
  once conversion is finished.

- [Costume Items Dialog] Split Costume Items dialog into two separate versions:
  one for World Tour/VPW64, and one for WCW/nWo Revenge.

  While the original dialog was compatible with all three games, Revenge's
  costume definition is slightly different from World Tour and VPW64.
  (Revenge does not include separate boot/foot bottom textures/palettes.)

- [FileTableDB] Small updates for No Mercy, VPW64, World Tour FileTableDBs.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 27 (2022/11/27)
---------------------------------
- Added Demo Match "Editor" for WWF No Mercy.
  Just like the VPW2 editor from last version, this one doesn't allow for
  editing or saving changes.

- [VPW2 Ruleset Editor] Added labels for rule values.

- Added No Mercy Ruleset "Editor".
  Same caveats as the one added for VPW2 in the previous version:
  - editing not implemented
  - data doesn't get written back

- Various updates to the TIM Tester tool:
  - Now supports files with multiple TIM images
  - Actually close the file stream once loading is finished
    (fixes a bug where you couldn't open the same file more than once)
  - Added Information feature
  - Added CLUT/Palette export (only reasonably working with 4bpp palettes at the moment)
  - Added texture export

- [Toki 1 Test Dialog] Standardized offset display; re-added offsets to labeled items.

Pre-Alpha Preview 26 (2022/09/24)
---------------------------------
- [GameDefinition] Store the revision as a byte instead of a float.
  This fixes an issue with trying to create projects for WCW vs. nWo World Tour
  NTSC-U v1.1/Revision A (and possibly any No Mercy project on v1.1/Rev A).

- [Default Costume Editors] Hovering over the color swatch for a few seconds will
  show a tooltip with the color name.

- [CostumeColorControl] Now supports hair colors (WM2K and later).

- [Default Costume Editors] Use CostumeColorControl for hair color.

- [LocationFile, DefaultGameData] Added entry for Attract Mode Demo Matches.
  Currently VPW2 only; still looking for No Mercy, as well as confirming
  if WM2K and earlier have them or not.

- Added very early Demo Match "Editor" for VPW2.
  Data is not editable. Values do not get written back yet.

  WWF No Mercy's demo match data needs re-confirmation; thanks to WldFb for
  finding it many years ago.

  Demo matches in general need to be confirmed for WM2K and earlier.

- [LocationFile, DefaultGameData] Added entry for Default Rulesets.
  Currently VPW2 only; data should be in all games, but formats will be different
  due to the presence/absence/changing of various rules.

- Added very early Match Ruleset "Editor" for VPW2.
  Data is not editable. Values do not get written back yet.
  For other games, data needs to be found (or in some cases, re-found).

* [FileTableDB] Small updates for Revenge and No Mercy FileTableDBs.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 25 (2022/08/12)
---------------------------------
* Various Danger Zone dialogs are now non-modal (i.e. you can interact with
  other open windows instead of being locked to a single dialog).
  This includes the Name Encoding/Decoding tool, the Toki 1 test dialog,
  and the Move Damage test dialog.

* [AkiText Editor] Add support for loading akitext tool format files
  via ".txt" extension.

* [Project Build] Updated some file conversion error messages to specify
  the unsupported file extension.

* [Project Build] Added support for AkiText conversion from .txt (akitext
  command line program) and .csv (Zoinkity's tab-delimited CSV format).
  Currently untested. Hopefully won't break anything if you try using it.

* [Ci Palette Editor] Add support for GIMP .txt palette format in LoadPaletteFile.

* [Project Build] Add more descriptive "Unable to convert" error messages for palettes.

* [File Table Dialog] Handle creating and updating palette files.
  Currently only enabled for raw CI4/CI8 palettes and VPW Studio palette format.

* [File Type Icons] Add icons for AkiAnimation and AkiFontChars file types.

* [No Mercy Default Costume Editor] Added missing items from Weapons/Props list.

* [File Table Dialog] Fixed list redraw when changing one or more entries.

* [File Table Dialog] Fix issue where modifying a single file table entry would
  not change the corresponding row's background color.

* [FileTableDB] Updates to a few FileTableDBs:
  - More entries added to VPW64
  - Fixed some issues with VPW2 file types
  - Added wrestler movesets and params to WM2K NTSC-J

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 24 (2022/07/20)
---------------------------------
- [Drag and Drop] The active working directory is now updated to the location
  of the project file during a drag and drop event.

  This allows saving the project file to work as expected, instead of creating
  a copy in the original working directory.

- Update active working directory upon opening a project (via non-drag-and-drop).

- [File Table Editor] Modified File Table entries now have a light red background.
  (Colors may be customizable in the future, if it's requested.)

- [File Table Entry Editor] Allow dragging and dropping a file onto the
  "Replacement File Path" text box to fill it in.

- [New Project Dialog] Allow dragging and dropping a file onto the "Base ROM File"
  text box to fill it in.

- [Project Properties Dialog] Allow dragging and dropping files onto the "Base
  ROM File" and "Custom Location File" text boxes.

- [CIPalette] Add support for GIMP .txt palette import/export.
  (It turns out you can't make a .gpl palette from an existing image in GIMP...)

- Added stand-alone VPW Studio palette tools to distribution under the "Tools"
  directory. Usage information can be found in the Manual.

Pre-Alpha Preview 23 (2022/06/12)
---------------------------------
* [FileTableDialog] MenuBackground replacement tool now shows specific
  error messages when:
  - Input image is not 320x240px
  - Input image is not 4bpp (16 colors)

* [TestScene3D] Change near clipping plane value from 1.0f to 0.01f.

* [TestScene3D] Change background color of Preview panel when giving the
  3D Preview control focus.

* [TestScene3D] Add mouse wheel zooming.

* [FileTableDB] Refactored error generation and display when loading data.
  FileTableDB class no longer spawns message boxes when coming across errors.
  Instead, the errors are put into a list, and the caller is meant to check for
  and display any errors.
  (Anyone who isn't looking at the source code won't notice this change,
  but it's important to me because the old method was "dirty".)

* [Wrestler Dialog] Fix error when trying to view wrestler moveset and params.

* [TestScene3D] Added alternate zoom method (press and hold both mouse buttons
  on the preview, then move the mouse up and/or down).

* [TestScene3D] Add scene panning via holding down right mouse button and moving
  inside the Preview panel. (Yes, it's a bit wonky.)

* [ROM Building] If a file lacks an extension, treat it as binary.

* [FileTableDialog] LoadFileTableDB() and ReloadFileTableDB() now use Parallel.ForEach().
  This should result in slightly faster operation for these two functions.
  Key word "should"... your mileage may vary.

* [MainForm] Officially move PNG conversion tools out of Danger Zone and into
  "Tools" menu.

* [FileTableDB] Updates to a few FileTableDBs:
  - WrestleMania 2000 NTSC-J now has all animations marked, an error fixed, and
    more entries added.
  - WCW/nWo Revenge's FileTableDB has reached around 90% FileType completion.
  - Fixed an error in World Tour's FileTableDB and marked some more entries.
  - VPW64 had some entries added as well.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 22 (2022/05/27)
---------------------------------
* [AkiText] Implement tab-separated CSV import. (Finally.)

* [AkiText] Implement "akitext" command line tool format import/export.

* [AkiTextEditor] Import/Export options now appear in a menu.

* [SelectTextureDialog] Fix crash when using images with forced FileTypes.

* [Toki1TestDialog] Added labels for modern Toki1 offsets 0x09 and 0x11.

* Disabled "Show In Taskbar" for various dialogs and editors.

* Fixed error when attempting to access Move Damage tool with a currently
  unsupported game.

* Various dialogs updated to allow closing with Escape button:
 - Toki1TestDialog
 - TimTester
 - StableDefParseTest
 - NameEncodeDecodeTool
 - MoveDamageTestDialog
 - FaceTester

* [FileTableDB] Updates to WrestleMania 2000 FileTableDB, bringing it to around
  99.93% marked! WCW/nWo Revenge's FileTableDB was also updated.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 21 (2022/05/14)
---------------------------------
* [FileTableDialog] Text search now also checks project-specific comments.

* [FileTableDialog] Added "Search FileType" option.

* [Intro "Editor"] Now supports all regions and revisions of No Mercy and WM2000.
  (Only Animation and Image data is supported; Sequence data is not yet found.)
  (Also, there's still no actual editing, hence the quotes around "Editor".)

* [FileTable Editor] Added Hex Viewer for replacement file data.
  (Note: this only shows the contents of the replacement file, not necessarily
  how it will appear in the ROM when it's built. This comment mainly concerns
  textures and palettes.)

* [FileTable_EditMultiEntryInfoDialog] Fix error related to blanking out Comment
  and/or Project Comment values.

* [ModelTool2] Added quick close shortcut (Escape key), like other forms.

* [AnimTest] Added Toki 1 index; allow form resizing; allow closing form via
  Escape key.

* [TexPreviewDialog] Fixed error when using scroll wheel on a 0x0px image.

* [AkiArchiveTool] Allow viewing file data as CI4Palette and CI8Palette.

* [Project Menu] Rename "Costumes" to "Costume Items", since this could get
  confused with default wrestler costumes.

* [Project Menu] Properly hide and disable "Build ROM" on closing a project.

* [AnimTest] Added "View" button for Toki1 values.

* [AkiArchiveTool] Added ability to close dialog with Escape key.

* [CiPaletteEditor] Added ability to close dialog with Escape key and
  accept changes with the Enter key.

* [SelectTextureDialog] Added ability to close dialog with Escape key and
  accept changes with the Enter key.

* Added new Danger Zone item: TestScene3D.
  It kind of works, but it's a pain to deal with!
  That's what you get when things are made by someone who doesn't understand
  3D programming all too well.
  (Also, there isn't a good solution for handling model and texture selection yet.)

* [FileTableDB] Various updates to a few FileTableDBs:
  - VPW2 had a small amount of updates
  - WM2K has over 800 changes
  - Revenge was also updated

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 20 (2022/04/22)
---------------------------------
* [StoryMode_VPW2 dialog] Complete overhaul thanks to research done by Melonbread.
  Compared to before...
  * Added Singles participants
  * Added Single and Tag Team groupings
  * Added Promotion and Relegation values
  * Added Event Schedule information
  * Added Booking Instructions
  Nothing is really editable yet, though...

* Added "Select Wrestler" dialog.
  The code is hacky and reveals a design flaw in the current codebase
  that should eventually be fixed.

* Added "vpw2 text index tool" to Danger Zone.
  VPW2 uses this really weird but makes-sense-in-context way of decoding text
  IDs. This has been semi-figured out.

* [AkiText Editor] Entries now start counting from 0.

* [FileTable] Added Project-Specific Comment field to FileTableEntry.
  (Various UI forms have been modified to support it.)

* [FileTypes] Added three new FileTypes:
  - RawCi4TexPal  - header-less CI4 palette and texture data
  - RawCi8Texture - header-less, palette-less CI8 texture data
  - OneBppTexture - 1bpp texture data (with header) [todo: needs support]

* [FileTable_EditEntryInfoDialog] ExtraData values for Image Width/Height are
  no longer capped at 640 and 480. (The new limit is 65535 for both values.)

* [ITexturePreviewDialog] Width/Height/Refresh area no longer resizes with the
  rest of the preview window.

Pre-Alpha Preview 19 (2022/01/29)
---------------------------------
* [Costumes Viewer] All lists now start counting from 0 and use hex instead of decimal.
  This change is mainly for consistency with the Costumes tab, which showed
  a different value than expected for the Body Type.

* [CI Palette Editor] Fix issue with importing JASC Paint Shop Pro palettes that
  was introduced when adding the .pal format sanity check.

* [Hex Viewer] Add Escape button shortcut for closing the Hex Viewer.

* [Font Viewer] Add Escape button shortcut for closing the form.

* [I4Texture Viewer, MenuBackground Preview] Fix Escape button not closing the form.
  (Unlike the others, the functionality was already coded, but the forms
  themselves were missing the necessary property to make it work.)

* [Select Font Characters Dialog] Add Enter/Escape keyboard shortcuts.

* [FileTableDB] Various updates to WrestleMania 2000 and World Tour FileTableDBs.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 18 (2021/11/28)
---------------------------------
* Replaced GetPixel/SetPixel with LockBits/UnlockBits in various places:
  - [AkiTexture] ToBitmap_CI, FromBitmap
  - [Ci8Texture] ToBitmap, FromBitmap
  - [Ci4Texture] ToBitmap, FromBitmap
  - [ModelTool2] UpdateTexture
  In theory, using LockBits/UnlockBits should be faster than iterating over
  each pixel. In practice, project build times seem relatively unchanged.
  Maybe memory usage is slightly better, I'm not sure.

  There are still portions of the program that can benefit from this change.
  They will be rewritten to do so in the future.

* [Z64Rom] Fix an error where GameVersion would be set using one of the game
  code bytes instead of the proper value.

* [NewProjectDialog] Add safeguards for input ROM selection.
  The following values are checked to ensure the correct ROM is being used
  for the project settings:
  - two-letter game code
  - region
  - revision/version

* [CI Palette Editor] Allow importing/exporting Adobe ACT format palettes.
  (The code existed, but it was not hooked up in the Palette Editor.)

* [CI Palette Editor] Display an error when importing a .pal file that is not
  JASC Paint Shop Pro format, since the Windows palette format uses the same
  file extension.

* [Hex Viewer] Implement "Select All" feature (Control+A).

* [FileTableDialog] Suggest a file name when using "Extract Raw".

* Rewrote a few image conversion error dialog messages.

* [Settings] "Quiet" Build Log Verbosity level added, and is now the default setting.
  This setting only logs important events (e.g. warnings and errors), and cuts
  down build times for larger projects considerably. (For example, a project
  replacing just under 1,200 files used to take anywhere from 55 seconds to
  1 minute to build on one of the testing machines. With the new "Quiet" setting,
  the same project took 12 seconds to build on the same machine.)

  It is *HIGHLY* recommended you change the Build Log Verbosity setting
  to "Quiet" if you have used the program before.

  This is merely a band-aid fix for a larger problem, as logging should not be
  adding excessive time to the build process.

* [I4Texture Viewer] Allow changing foreground/drawing color.

* [No Mercy FileTableDB] Made the Tournament background image entries a bit
  more obvious, instead of just being labeled "KOR" and possibly being confused
  for the pre-match KOTR background.
  (I made this error myself, so I have a vested interest in fixing it.)

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 17 (2021/10/03)
---------------------------------
* [Hex Viewer] Fixed issue where copied data could not be pasted into external
  hex editors. As a consequence, all spaces are removed from copied byte data.

* [Project] Added Wrestler Definition file.
  This acts similar to the Stable Definition file, and allows for editing of
  various wrestler data that previously required a hex editor.

  Writing wrestler data back to the ROM has been tested for:
  - WWF No Mercy
  - Virtual Pro-Wrestling 2
  - WWF WrestleMania 2000

  The other three games have yet to be tested.

* [No Mercy Wrestler Dialog] Various updates:
  - Read Wrestler Definition file if it exists
  - Write Wrestler Definition file if it doesn't exist
  - Allow for editing Titantron, Theme Music, Height, Weight, and Profile Index

* [VPW2 Wrestler Dialog] Various updates:
  - Read Wrestler Definition file if it exists
  - Write Wrestler Definition file if it doesn't exist
  - Allow for editing Theme Music, Name Call, Height, Weight, Voices,
    and Profile Index

* [WM2K Wrestler Dialog] Various updates:
  - Read Wrestler Definition file if it exists
  - Write Wrestler Definition file if it doesn't exist
  - Allow for editing Titantron, Theme Music, Height, and Weight

* [Revenge Wrestler Dialog] Read Wrestler Definition file if it exists.

* [LocationFile] Added support for "FTID" entries, which map to IDs in the FileTable.
  
* [LocationFile] "RAM" entry type is now considered deprecated.

* [DefaultGameData] Added a dictionary of relevant file IDs per-game.
  This is meant to solve a few design issues in the code, as well as allow
  for proper handling of WrestleMania 2000 NTSC-J in various dialogs.

* [Toki 1 Test Dialog] Add support for WM2K NTSC-J.

* [Move Damage Test Dialog] Add support for WM2K NTSC-J.

* [Wrestler Dialog] Fixed issue related to loading a WrestleMania 2000 NTSC-U or
  PAL project, then loading a WrestleMania 2000 NTSC-J project (or vice versa).

* [Font Dialog] Added proper fallback character sets for World Tour and Revenge.

* [World Tour/VPW64 Wrestler Dialog] Read Wrestler Definition file if it exists.

* [ModelTool2] Texture and palette file IDs are now remembered upon selection,
  and will be restored when entering the Load Texture dialog.

* [AkiModel] Ignore vertex colors in GetNormalizedCoords if the top bit of
  Number of Vertices is set.

* [ModelTool2] Replaced (unknown) label with Vertex Influence.

* More FileTableDB updates again. It's a long battle, but we're getting there.
  Very large updates have been made to the VPW2 and No Mercy FileTableDBs.
  VPW2 and No Mercy are almost 100% marked now (!).

  Of course, some entries still need proper comments/explanations, but marking
  them with the correct filetype (or Binary, when support for something isn't
  currently available) is a very important step in figuring everything out.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 16 (2021/09/18)
---------------------------------
* The manual has been updated considerably, compared to previous versions.

* [Manual] Added game-specific pages.
  Much like the rest of the Manual, these are incomplete, but will be filled
  with more information as time passes.

* [Hex Viewer] Actually implement copying of hex values to clipboard.
  (I thought it was built-in to the new control, but it turns out I still
  needed to handle some stuff manually.)

* [Location Files] Added support for WCW vs. nWo: World Tour NTSC-U v1.0 and PAL.
  Yes, finally, after 3 years of being unsupported.

* [Hex Viewer] Allow Hex Viewer to be resized vertically.

* [File Table Dialog] Fixed an issue related to searching after creating
  a new project.

* [WM2K Wrestler Dialog] Add short names to wrestler list, so it's not just
  a bunch of ID4 values. This brings it in line with the VPW2 and No Mercy
  wrestler dialogs.

* [VPW2 and No Mercy Wrestler Dialogs] Save changes when editing the AkiText
  archive with the default wrestler names. You are no longer required to make
  these changes from the File Table editor.

* [VPW2, No Mercy, WM2K Stable Dialogs] Added stable names to list, so it's not
  just a bunch of numbers.

* [Main Form] Added Help -> Game Specific Documentation, which opens a HTML
  document with information for the game you're currently editing.

* [File Table Entry Information (single)] Changed keyboard accelerator for
  "Comment" from 'O' to 'M'. Yes, it was the same as the OK button before.
  Ouch.

* [File Table Entry Information (single)] Added keyboard accelerators for
  "Browse" button, Image Width/Height, Default Palette ID, Horizontal Mirror,
  and Vertical Mirror.

* [File Table Dialog] Added Hex Viewer keyboard shortcut (Control+H).

* [File Table Dialog] Added status bar, containing the number of items
  currently selected. Probably of limited utility.

* [No Mercy Wrestler Dialog] Show converted weight values (including ??, ???,
  !!!, and the Crash Holly "400 lbs." entries).

* [No Mercy Wrestler Dialog] Show converted height values (including ??, ???,
  !!! and the Crash Holly 6'6" entries).

* [WM2K Wrestler Dialog] Show converted height values.
  ("???" values were already supported.)

* [WM2K Wrestler Dialog] Added ability to view default costume data.
  (No editing yet.)

* Added World Tour and VPW64 Stable viewer. (No editing yet.)

* Added Adobe .act format to the palette Open/Save filetype filter string.
  (.act import/export support was added back in 2019, but the filter string
  wasn't updated to show it as an option. Oops.)

* Added World Tour and VPW64 Wrestler Dialog. (No editing yet, of course.)

* Various behind-the-scenes changes to prepare for supporting the AKI
  PlayStation 1 wrestling games (Virtual Pro-Wrestling and WCW vs. the World).

  These games are not currently supported in VPW Studio, and there is no
  planned timeframe for support to be added. Lots of information still needs
  to be figured out, and many N64-only assumptions need to be fixed.

* As expected, more FileTableDB changes were made. Aside from more files being
  labeled in WWF No Mercy, Virtual Pro-Wrestling 64, WrestleMania 2000, and
  WCW/nWo Revenge, there were a few bugged entries. These issues have been fixed.

  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 15 (2021/08/25)
---------------------------------
* Target .NET Framework version changed from 4.6.1 to 4.7.2.

* Replaced SharpDX with OpenTK.
  Please delete any SharpDX .dll files in the VPW Studio program directory.
  Specifically, these files are no longer necessary:
  - SharpDX.D3DCompiler.dll
  - SharpDX.Desktop.dll
  - SharpDX.Direct3D11.dll
  - SharpDX.dll
  - SharpDX.DXGI.dll
  - SharpDX.Mathematics.dll

* [AkiModel] Fixed vertical texture map offsets in Wavefront OBJ export.

* Removed incomplete GameShark Tool.
  It will be replaced with a stand-alone tool, available sometime in the future.
  Hopefully.

* [No Mercy Wrestler Editor] Allow the use of an edited AkiText for Profile data.

* Renamed NoMercyText to MenuItems_NoGroup and added an editor for it.

* [No Mercy Default Costume Editor] Properly save changes, added missing items,
  and made remaining options editable.

* [Project Settings] Removed ability to set Game/Product Code, as emulators and
  flashcarts use this to determine what save data type is required. You can still
  set the region code, though.
  (Filing this under "things I had to learn the hard way, so you don't have to".)

* Rearranged Danger menu to put the most useful (read: PNG conversion) tools
  at the top.

* Added No Mercy MenuItems_Shop data editor.
  It's a bit cumbersome, as you have to press a "make changes" button for data
  to be written back. This will likely change in the future.

* [Project File] Allow relative path for the input/base ROM file.
  (This is only possible once the project file has been saved.)

* [Hex Viewer] Replaced ByteViewer control with Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox.
  Contents are still read-only, but can be selected and copied now.

* [Move Damage Test] Actually show values for WWF No Mercy.

* [File Table Dialog] Perform "does file exist?" checks for AkiText,
  MenuItems_NoGroup, and MenuItems_Shop filetypes.

* ModelTool2 dialog upgraded and slightly redesigned.
  Now features a static 3D preview, with the ability to load textures from ROM.

* Added TIM Tester (PS1 texture format) to Danger menu, as part of initial steps
  towards supporting the PS1 AKI wrestling games.

* As usual, there's a few FileTableDB updates.
  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 14 (2020/02/16)
---------------------------------
* [StoryMode_VPW2 "editor"] Display wrestler names next to ID2 values.

* [FileTable_EditEntryInfoDialog] Fixed issue with file types being wrongly assigned.
  (Yes, again.)

* [General] Fixed issue where current development versions of Project64 were
  treating the currently active directory in VPW Studio as the emulator's home
  directory. You would only run into this issue if the PJ64 directory settings
  were set to use "$AppPath", but better safe than sorry.

* [General] Opening a project via command line argument or drag and drop should now
  be a little more user-proof.
  (In other words, only open files with a ".vpwsproj" extension.)

* [Project Properties] Implemented changing the directory for Assets and
  Project File paths.

* [AkiArchive] Attempt to fix up certain archive entries.

* [AkiModel] Updated Wavefront OBJ export texture mapping handling.

* [Build Log Verbosity] Changed default value to "Normal" (was previously "Detailed").

* Hey, don't be surprised by this one, but randymanfoo provided even more
  FileTableDB updates for WWF No Mercy.
  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 13 (2019/09/25)
---------------------------------
Wow, that's a long time between updates.

* [CostumeDefs_Early] A few operational changes for consistency's sake:
  - Use hex numbers for Body Types list.
  - Show masked Body Type in the Costumes tab.

* [File Conversion] Fix VPWStudio Palette files not being accepted for CI8Palette conversion.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Fixed displayed weight values not being corrected.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Fixed issue where a weight value of 0 would not update the
  text display to the right.

* [CiPalette Editor] Now loads data from replacement file if set.

* [Program] New icon design.

* [AkiAnimation] Rotation changed to signed byte. (Makes sense, really)

* [ROM Build Process] Added support for Ci4Background conversion.

* [Ci4Palette, Ci8Palette] Preliminary support for Adobe ACT palette import.
  Does not support sub-palettes yet.

* [CiPaletteEditor] Allow importing Adobe ACT palettes.

* [FileTypes] Redid the logic that handles valid FileTypes for the specific games.

* [FileTable Dialogs] Fixed errors related to FileTypes not being properly set.

* More FileTableDB updates, including a large No Mercy update from randymanfoo.
  To update your project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database ->
  Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 12 (2018/11/07)
---------------------------------
* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Height and Weight values can now be changed.
  (Data is not yet written back to ROM.)

* [VPW2 Costume Editor control] Fix error where Mask Head Shape was ignored.

* [FileTable] Fix issue related to ExtraData when creating a new project.

* [FileTable EditEntryInfo Dialog] Fix an issue related to ExtraData.

  based on selected FileType option. Currently only works for CI4/CI8 palettes
  and CI4/CI8/AKI textures.

* [FileTable Editor] Search now reports when you've reached the last requested item.

* [FileTable EditMultiEntryInfoDialog] Set the unsaved changes flag if any changes
  are made. (It wasn't doing so previously.)

* [FileTableEntry ExtraData] Added Horizontal and Vertical Mirroring for textures.

* [FileTable EditMultiEntryInfoDialog] Fix an error related to erasing a file's
  replacement path.

* More FileTableDB updates. A few more entries have ExtraData. To update your
  project, open the File Table dialog, then choose Database -> Reload File
  Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 11 (2018/10/16)
---------------------------------
* [FileTableDialog] Implement "Find Previous" via Shift+F3 keyboard shortcut.

* [FileTableDB] Added support for "Extra Data". This currently includes:
  - Image Width and Height (for I*Textures)
  - Intended Palette ID (for CI4 and CI8 textures)

* [FileTable_CiTexturePreviewDialog] Fix crash related to palette comments,
  or lack thereof.

* VPW2 Default Costume Editor added and implemented.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] A few updates regarding wrestler names:
  - Short names can now use data from replacement FileTable ID 006C.
  - Wrestler profile data now also uses data from replacement FileTable ID 006C.

* [VPW2 Stable Editor] Load custom group names from replacement FileTable ID 006C.

* [ROM Build Process] Fixed issue where relative Output ROM paths
  were seen as invalid during the directory check.

* FileTableDB updates again. This time, a number of entries have "Extra Data".
  This primarily concerns I4Textures, CI4Textures, and CI8Textures.

Pre-Alpha Preview 10 (2018/09/30)
---------------------------------
* Started work on VPW2 Story Mode/RRS Editor.

* Added the ability to override a FileType for a specified entry.
  Before this, reloading the FileTableDB comments would overwrite any changes
  you made for files that didn't match the FileTableDB's entry. Useful when
  replacing leftover files from previous games.

* [AkiTextEditor] Add information about the current file to the title bar.

* [Toki1 Test Tool] Added support for Revenge, WM2K, and No Mercy.
  World Tour and VPW64 have shorter Toki1 values and are not "officially"
  supported yet.

* [Hex Viewer] Added comment in title bar when loading file from FileTable.

* [Ci*Palette] Added support for exporting GIMP palette files.

* Started work on Move Damage tool (WM2K and VPW2 only for now).

* VERY LARGE update to FileTableDBs. All animation values should be marked, even
  if most don't have a comment attached. (WrestleMania 2000 NTSC-J has not been
  updated in this manner.) To update your project, open the File Table dialog,
  then choose Database -> Reload File Table Database.

  WrestleMania 2000 NTSC-J's Japanese messages are stored as AkiTextures.
  These entries have been marked (but not translated).

Pre-Alpha Preview 9 (2018/09/15)
--------------------------------
* [No Mercy Default Costume Editor] Fixed "Hairy 2" Body Type being listed as Female.

* [No Mercy Default Costume Editor] Ring Attire list updated with sections.

* Dragging and dropping a project file to open it now properly loads the
  Input ROM and LocationFile data.

* [WCW/nWo Revenge Wrestler Editor] Added string displays for Wrestler Name,
  Height, and Weight Pointers.

* Location file is re-loaded when changing an open project to a new game type.

* Valid menus are reset when changing an open project to a new game type.

* [CI Texture Previewer] Added ability to set preview image background color.

* [FileTypes] Added Ci4Background, used in WWF No Mercy for the Smackdown Mall
  background images. Currently read-only.

* [CI Texture Previewer] Allowed dialog to be resized.

* [Animation Tool] Add the ability to export animation values to the clipboard,
  for use with S.K. Stylez's Animation Editor spreadsheet.

* [FileTableDialog] Fix issue where reloading the FileTableDB multiple times
  would cause an error.

* [FileTableDialog] Added rudimentary Search and Find Next features.
  Still not perfect.

* [AkiArchiveTool] Suggest filenames for extracted files.

* [ROM Building] Build log now displays error messages in the following cases:
  - Unable to convert relative replacement path
  - Requested replacement file does not exist

* [ROM Building] Build log displays error messages for any files that were
  unable to be converted.

* Various updates to FileTableDBs, as usual. To update your project, open
  the File Table dialog, then choose Database -> Reload File Table Database.

  One note of importance with the FileTableDB update in Pre-Alpha Preview 9:
  All of the WrestleMania 2000 and No Mercy Titantron frames are now marked.

  Interestingly enough, Steve Blackman's Titantron in WM2K has four frames
  that appear to go unused. The sequence depicts a leg sweep from a different
  angle than the corresponding move in the version of his Titantron uploaded
  to YouTube.

  Another advancement of note is the beginning of documenting the Animation
  File IDs.

Pre-Alpha Preview 8 (2018/08/31)
--------------------------------
* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Height and Weight now show both hex and "real" values.
  The special values ("???") still need to be handled.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Fixed incorrect numbering of Voice B items.

* Implemented first version of WCW/nWo Revenge Championship Editor.

* [Project Properties] Disable "overwrite file?" prompt when setting the output
  ROM path to an existing file.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Added ability to view wrestler appearance data.
  (Currently uses a hex editor view; custom dialog to come later.)

* [No Mercy Wrestler Editor] Added ability to view wrestler appearance data.
  (Uses a custom dialog, unlike VPW2. It's easier when you only have to deal
  with one costume at a time versus four... The current design was quickly
  hacked together just to get something working.)

* [VPW2 Face Tester] Fixed tab order and added keyboard accelerators.

* [VPW2 Face Tester] Added workaround for a CI8 Front Hair texture.

* [AkiArchive Tool] Added ability to view TEX files and ITextures in archives.

* Various updates to FileTableDBs, as usual.

Pre-Alpha Preview 7 (2018/07/28)
--------------------------------
* [Main Form] Added ability to open Project Files by dragging and dropping.

* [WM2K Wrestler Editor] Added missing Costume Pointer text boxes.

* Added AKI Archive Tool, which replaces "Packed File Tool"/Tools -> Archive File.

* Started work on WCW/nWo Revenge Wrestler Editor.

* Various updates to FileTableDBs, as usual. To update your project, open
  the File Table dialog, then choose Database -> Reload File Table Database.

Pre-Alpha Preview 6 (2018/07/17)
--------------------------------
* [FileTable editor] Implemented multiple raw file export.

* [FileTable editor] Implemented multi-select version of Edit Information dialog.

* [VPW2 Wrestler Editor] Quality of life improvements, including adding
  accelerators/keyboard shortcuts and wrestler short names next to the ID4
  in the list.

* [Project File, Project Properties] Added game region setting.

* [No Mercy Wrestler Editor] Same changes as VPW2 Wrestler Editor.

* [Project File] Added Stable Definition File path. This file is generated by
  the program after pressing OK in the Stable Editor.

* [VPW2 Stable Editor] Write out StableDefs.txt and set the Stable Definition
  File path in the ProjectFile if StableDefs.txt doesn't exist.

* No Mercy Stable Editor added. Acts the same as VPW2 Stable Editor.

* [ROM Building] Write Stable Definitions to ROM for WM2K, VPW2, and No Mercy.

* WM2K Stable Editor has been updated with the same functionality as VPW2 and No Mercy.

* [Internals] Added Hex Viewer Manager, allowing for multiple Hex Viewers to be opened.

* [Danger Zone] Added ROM slice test.

* Help -> Manual now shows the (very incomplete) manual.

* [FileTable Editor] Hex editor now works when selecting multiple items.

* Fixed a very bad bug that prevented showing the proper Project Property values
  when opening another project in the same session.

Pre-Alpha Preview 5 (2018/06/30)
--------------------------------
* No Mercy Default Costume Data class added.
  Thanks to jordyad for documenting the values. Nothing user-facing yet.

* CITexture and ITexture preview dialogs now include file comments
  in the title bar.

* The program will now attempt to report issues with the FileTableDB when
  reloading the Database.

* MenuBackground converter in the FileTable editor.
  Right click on the first file in a MenuBackground collection, choose
  "MenuBackground Replacement", and open a 320x240 16-color PNG file.
  This will automatically convert the image into the proper format, create
  a directory in ProjectFiles\Background\ named after the input filename,
  and update the Project FileTable with the relevant paths.

* If you want to convert a MenuBackground without needing a project open,
  there's a MenuBackground converter available in the Danger Zone.

* AkiText editor now includes a Control Codes reference.

* Various small changes that I haven't bothered documenting here.

* As usual, more entries are defined in the FileTableDB for some games.
  Both No Mercy and VPW2 have at least 250 new entries in their FileTableDBs.

Pre-Alpha Preview 4 (2018/05/23)
--------------------------------
* Font Dialog implemented.
  This replaces the font image export as the default Aki*Font handler in the
  FileTable editor. If an AkiFontChars file is not defined in the FileTable,
  a fallback character set will be used. This fallback set may not be accurate
  to what the font actually contains.

* Implemented VPW Studio Palette format.
  This is similar to the JASC Paint Shop Pro palette format, but it also
  supports alpha/transparency values and CI4 sub-palettes.

* Added Stable Editor for WrestleMania 2000.

* "Play ROM" will now build the ROM if it hasn't been built.
  This makes the "Build and Play ROM" option (mostly) redundant.

* AkiAnimation file type added, though not complete yet.
  However, you can view the Animation data... kind of.

* As usual, more entries are defined in the FileTableDB for some games.

Pre-Alpha Preview 3 (2018/04/23)
--------------------------------
* FileTable change support added for:
 * Virtual Pro-Wrestling 64
 * WCW vs. nWo World Tour (NTSC-U v1.1/Revision A)

* VPW2 Face Tester now handles item offsets properly, I think????

* Added AkiTextEditor. This replaces the two previous AkiText dialogs.
  Note: Importing from CSV does not work yet.

* Added "Build and Play" Project menu item (Shift+F5).

* Started working on the ModelTool2, which will eventually render 3D items.

* FileTable editor now allows you to use the Hex Editor for any item type.

Pre-Alpha Preview 2 (2018/04/15)
--------------------------------
* Now supports FileTable changes for the following games:
  - WCW/nWo Revenge (NTSC-U, PAL)
  - WWF WrestleMania 2000 (NTSC-U, NTSC-J, PAL)
  - WWF No Mercy (NTSC-U v1.0/v1.1, PAL v1.0/v1.1)

CI* Editor Improvements:
* Implemented CI4 sub-palette import/export.
* Allow for selection of sub-palettes.

* Added "Build Log Verbosity" option.

Pre-Alpha Preview 1 (2018/04/10)
--------------------------------
First release to testers.

Origin Point (2018/02/11)
-------------------------
Project begins.
