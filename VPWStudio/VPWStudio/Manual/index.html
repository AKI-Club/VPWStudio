<h2><a name="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>VPW Studio is a ROM hacking tool for the games in AKI Corporation's
<em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling</em> series.</p>

<p>As of 2018, the primary accepted solution for making changes to the AKI
wrestling games are GameShark codes and emulator-only plugin-based texture
replacements. Anyone who wanted to play projects using these methods on
console could not fully do so.</p>

<p>The primary inspiration for VPW Studio is the Goldeneye Setup Editor,
which works directly on game data. This allows hacks to work on console,
assuming you follow all of the internal "rules" of the game and the N64's
supported data formats.</p>

<h3>Supported Games</h3>
<p>Currently, only the AKI wrestling games on the Nintendo 64 are supported:</p>

<p>Note that not every game supports every portion of VPW Studio. Supported games
are listed in the specific sections for each tool.</p>

<p>Of the remaining AKI wrestling games, it's more likely the PlayStation 1 games
(<em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling</em> and <em>WCW vs. the World</em>) will be supported
before games on later systems. These games are not considered the primary focus,
however, so it will be a while before support is implemented.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="Requirements">Requirements and Notes</a></h2>
<p>In order to use VPW Studio, you'll need a few things.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>.NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher.</li>
<li>Any of the above listed games in Z64 ROM format. No other N64 ROM formats are
supported at this time. Please convert non-Z64 format ROMs with a tool, such as
<a href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/">uCON64</a>.</li>
<li>Patience. (This program is not yet complete, and has a long way to go.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>This program is currently a GIANT work in progress. As such, a lot of things are
not implemented yet.</li>
<li>Since the program is a work in progress, any and all file formats are subject
to change. Don't get too attached to your projects.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><a name="MainInterface">Main Interface</a></h2>
<img src="./img/main_interface.png" title="Main Interface" />
<p>The main form appears when you boot VPW Studio. Most of the functionality is disabled
until a project file is opened, though there are a few tools that don't require a project.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="ProgramOptions">Program Options</a></h2>
<p>VPW Studio has a small set of options, primarily targeted towards the building
and playing process. Select Tools &rarr; Program Options to open the dialog.</p>

<h3>Emulator</h3>
<p>The "Emulator" section of the Program Options dialog allows you to set up an
emulator to use for testing the changed ROM.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Path</strong> &ndash; Path to the emulator executable file.</li>
<li><strong>Arguments</strong> &ndash; Any additional arguments to be passed to the emulator.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build</h3>
<p>The "Build" portion of the Program Options dialog currently only contains an
option to modify the verbosity of the build log. The default option is "Normal".</p>

<p>If you have an older computer, setting the Build Log Verbosity to "Minimal"
can shorten build times.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="ProjectFiles">Project Files</a></h2>
<p>VPW Studio primarily operates on the concept of Project Files. This method was
chosen due to the number of total conversion hacks created by the AKI hacking communities.</p>

<p>Project Files have the extension <code>.vpwsproj</code>. Technical information
about the Project File format can be found in <a href="./appendix_b.html#ProjectFile">Appendix B, Section 5</a>.</p>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>
<p>Aside from the Project File itself, the project expects a specific structure.
Upon saving a project for the first time, two directories will be made in the location
the project was saved:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Assets</strong> &ndash; Assets are the raw files that get converted
to various game formats. This is typically where your PNG textures live.</li>
<li><strong>ProjectFiles</strong> &ndash; Anything in the ProjectFiles folder is
meant to be ready to insert (a.k.a. already in formats the game is expecting).</li>
</ul>

<p>VPW Studio expects these folders to exist for any saved project. You can change
their locations via the <a href="#ProjectProperties">Project Properties</a> dialog.</p>

<h3>Creating a New Project</h3>
<p>Getting started with the main portion of the program requires creating a new project.
Select "New Project..." from the File menu, which will bring up the New Project dialog.</p>

<img src="./img/new_project.png" title="New Project Dialog" />

<p>The options presented are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Name</strong> &ndash; The name of this project.</li>
<li><strong>Author(s)</strong> &ndash; Names of people involved in the project. Optional, but recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Game Type</strong> &ndash; Set the game type.</li>
<li><strong>Base ROM File</strong> &ndash; Set the location of the base Z64 ROM.</li>
<li><strong>Output ROM File</strong> &ndash; Set the location of the built Z64 ROM.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Location File</strong> &ndash; When checked, allows you to use a
custom Location File. Helpful if you've already made changes to the base ROM that
result in differences from the default Location File for the specified Game Type.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these may be changed later in the <a href="#ProjectProperties">Project
Properties</a> dialog. Upon pressing OK, you will be sent back to the main screen,
with the main form updating to reflect the new project.</p>

<h3>Open an Existing Project</h3>
<p>To open a VPW Studio Project File, choose "Open Project..." from the File menu.
After selecting a project file, the program interface will update to reflect what
game is being edited.</p>

<h3>Save, Save As</h3>
<p>When you want to save changes to a project, there are two options: "Save Project",
and "Save Project As". Both are available from the File menu.</p>

<h4>Save Project</h4>
<p>The first time you save a new project, the program will ask you for a location
and name to save the file. Upon doing so, two directories will be created in the
directory where the project file is saved: "Assets" and "ProjectFiles". "Assets"
is meant for unconverted items (such as .png images), while "ProjectFiles" will
store any files that are in game-native formats.</p>

<h4>Save Project As</h4>
<p>"Save Project As" is similar to saving normally, but it always asks for a filename
and doesn't automatically create the "Assets" and "ProjectFiles" directories.</p>

<h3><a name="ProjectProperties">Project Properties</a></h3>
<p>If you need to edit any of the project's properties, you can do so from
Project &rarr; Project Properties. While some of these options are set from
creating a new project, others can only be changed in this dialog.</p>

<h4>Main Tab</h4>
<img src="./img/project_properties-main.png" title="Project Properties - Main Tab" />
<p>The options in this section are the same as the matching entries in the New Project
dialog.</p>

<h4>Output ROM</h4>
<img src="./img/project_properties-outputrom.png" title="Project Properties - Output ROM Tab" />
<ul>
<li><strong>Output ROM File</strong> &ndash; Set the location of the built Z64 ROM.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Game Name</strong> &ndash; Set the internal game name.</li>
<li><strong>Product Code</strong> &ndash; The two letter code for the game ID. Leave this alone unless you know what you're doing.</li>
<li><strong>Product Region</strong> &ndash; Pick a pre-set region, or set a custom letter.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Project Files</h4>
<img src="./img/project_properties-projectfiles.png" title="Project Properties - Project Files Tab" />
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Files Path</strong> &ndash; Path to files that will be converted to game-native formats.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Files Path</strong> &ndash; Path to files that are already in game-native formats.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Location File</strong> &ndash; Path to a custom location file. Only useful if you're working from a ROM that has non-trivial code changes.</li>
<li><strong>GameShark Code File</strong> &ndash; Path to the GameShark code file for this project.</li>
<li><strong>Wrestler Names File</strong> &ndash; Path to the Wrestler Name file for this project. (Currently unused)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build ROM</h3>
<p>To build a ROM with the changes you've made, select "Build ROM" from the "Project"
menu (Keyboard shortcut: Shift+Ctrl+B). This will bring up a build log window, which
provides updates on the build process.</p>

<p>Depending on the speed of your computer, the number of FileTable entries being
modified, and the Build Log Verbosity setting, this process may be relatively short
(around 10 seconds) or long.</p>

<h3>Play ROM</h3>
<p>If you want to test the changes in an emulator, select "Play ROM" from the "Project"
menu (Keyboard shortcut: F5). If the changed ROM hasn't been built yet, it will build
the ROM before playing it.</p>
<p>For this to work, you must set up the emulator details in the <a href="#ProgramOptions">Program Options</a> section.</p>

<p>(todo: this portion of the program requires a 3D renderer, and I am not yet smart enough to do that -f)</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="Championships">Championships</a></h2>
<p>The Championships editor differs for each game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WCW vs. nWo World Tour</strong>, <strong>Virtual Pro-Wrestling 64</strong>, and <strong>WCW/nWo Revenge</strong> &ndash;
This doubles as the Story Mode/Champion Road editor.</li>
<li><strong>WWF WrestleMania 2000</strong> and <strong>Virtual Pro-Wrestling 2</strong> &ndash; Edit the possible designs
available when making a new belt.</li>
<li><strong>WWF No Mercy</strong> &ndash; Edit the default championship data.</li>
</ul>

<p>(todo)</p>

<h3>Navigation Menu</h3>
<p>The Navigation menu contains various functions to help you find entries in the FileTable.</p>

<h4>Go To</h4>
<p>The "Go To" option (keyboard shortcut Ctrl+G) allows you to jump to a specific file number.
The value is in hexadecimal, so be aware of that.</p>

<h4>Search and Find Next</h4>
<p>You can search for a file based off of its comment text using the Search function
(keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F). Once a search has begun, you can use "Find Next" (keyboard
shortcut F3) to search for the next comment. Holding Shift while pressing F3 moves backwards.</p>

<p>Note: Currently, the search can not be told to skip over item numbers.</p>

<h3>Database Menu</h3>
<p>The Database menu only contains one option, but it's important if you've upgraded
to a new version of VPW Studio. "Reload File Table Database" will let you update
your project's FileTable with the current data in the FileTableDB file for the
current game.</p>

<h3>Export Menu</h3>
<p>The Export Menu is something most people won't ever need to touch. Despite being
able to export a list for Midwaydec, Zoinkity has said that program is dead.
The "Export CSV" option is only of use for people dealing with disassemblies.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="Menus">Menus</a></h2>
<p>The Menus option (Project &rarr; Menus) allows you to change how the items
are laid out on various game menus.</p>

<p>(todo: haven't even designed this because I don't have the data mapped)</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="Moves">Moves</a></h2>
<p>The Moves section (Project &rarr; Moves) deals with every move and animation found in the game.</p>

<p>(todo: this takes a lot of work to get right, considering moves are composed of multiple parts (toki1, damage, actual animation data))</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="SoundMusic">Sound/Music</a></h2>
<p>The Sound and Music editor (Project &rarr; Sound/Music) will eventually allow you to preview and change
sounds. (This includes the theme music found in WM2K, VPW2, and No Mercy.)</p>

<p>(todo: I haven't even begun to think about this; you're better off using SubDrag's N64 sound/music tools right now)</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="Stables">Stables</a></h2>
<p>The Stable Editor (Project &rarr; Stables) allows you to change the default stable data.
The stable data controls how the wrestlers are grouped and displayed in the menus.</p>

<h2><a name="Glossary">Appendix A: Glossary</a></h2>
<p>The Virtual Pro-Wrestling series hacking communities use jargon to refer to
some items and concepts. These terms can be confusing when first encountered.
In addition, certain programs are involved whose name and function are not
immediately obvious.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Addy</dt>
<dd>Short for "address", as in "memory address".</dd>

<dt>Broad Action</dt>
<dd>The general action the wrestler is performing.</dd>

<dt>CI4</dt>
<dd>Nintendo 64's 16 color texture format.</dd>

<dt>CI8</dt>
<dd>Nintendo 64's 256 color texture format.</dd>

<dt>I4</dt>
<dd>Nintendo 64's 16 value intensity texture format.</dd>

<dt>ID2</dt>
<dd>One of the two ways of identifying a wrestler. This value is one byte
and controls indexing into various arrays and structures. ID2 values are
always given in hex.</dd>

<dt>ID4</dt>
<dd>One of the two ways of identifying a wrestler. This value is two bytes,
being used as a unique identifier (not necessarily matching the ID2 order).
ID4 values are always given in hex.</dd>

<dt>Midwaydec</dt>
<dd>A tool by Zoinkity that handles various N64 archive formats.</dd>

<dt>Offsetter</dt>
<dd>Another Zoinkity-created tool for inserting files into a VPW2 ROM and fixing the relevant offsets.</dd>

<dt>Toki 1</dt>
<dd>Originally known as "Animation Stat Mods 1", the Toki 1 values control
a large number of parameters for moves.</dd>

<dt>Toki 2</dt>
<dd>Originally known as "Animation Stat Mods 2", the Toki 2 values control:
<ul>
<li>Player's "general" animation at the end of the previous animation.</li>
<li>Facing direction at the end of the animation.</li>
<li>Number of frames in the animation.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Toki 3</dt>
<dd>Toki 3 values are related to items in the FileTable. Depending on who you ask,
they're either the file IDs themselves, or the location of the data in the ROM (relative
to the start location of the first file in the archive).</dd>
