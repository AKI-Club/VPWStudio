<h2><a name="Warning">Warning</a></h2>
<p>VPW Studio was primarily created for my own use. I have spent over two decades
learning about the internals of these games, and a lot of this program assumes
that you either know the necessary information, or you know
<a href="https://vpw.ajworld.net/">where to get it</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This program does NOT hold your hand, and it is not particularly
user-friendly at this time.</strong> You have been warned.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>VPW Studio is a ROM hacking tool for the games in AKI Corporation's
<em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling</em> series. The initial focus is on AKI's
Nintendo 64 games, though support for the PlayStation 1 AKI wrestling games
is planned for later. The primary inspiration for VPW Studio is the
<a href="http://n64vault.com/wiki:setup-editor-global">Goldeneye Setup Editor</a>,
which works directly on game data. This allows hacks to work on console,
assuming you follow all of the internal "rules" of the game and the
various (console and game-specific) data formats.</p>

<p>When work on this program began in 2018, the primary method of making changes
to AKI's N64 wrestling games involved GameShark codes and emulator-only plugin-based
texture replacements. Anyone who wanted to play projects using these methods on
the original hardware could not fully do so. The replacement textures in these
projects are often higher resolution than the originals and typically use more
than 256 colors. Both of these attributes combine to make a situation that can't
reasonably be handled with the N64's limited amount of texture RAM. GameShark
codes pose their own problems, as you have to decide if you want to use a real
GameShark, or rely on your flash cart's support for GameShark codes. It's possible
to use GameShark hardware with the 64drive, for example, but you have to load
the ROM over USB via a command line tool, and you still have to deal with the
GameShark's finicky hardware, which can freeze the game if you look at it wrong
or mess up when pressing the GS button. The stock Everdrive64 OS supports GameShark
codes, but only a limited amount, and without any clear way to separate and label
codes. (Perhaps a third party OS fixes this; I am not sure.) No matter what route
you take, you'd be best served finding a way to import codes from a text file,
as the amount of GameShark codes these projects typically have is in the
<em>thousands</em>. That's not an exaggeration, either:</p>

<blockquote>Every attire [in AKI Evolution] requires anywhere between 842 and 1,043
lines of [GameShark] code[s].
<p>-Chuckiepk on <a href="https://twitter.com/Chuckie_PK/status/1434220438616477698">twitter</a>, September 4th, 2021</p>
</blockquote>

<p>VPW Studio aims to make it easier to change the existing game data, reducing
the need for GameShark codes that do the same thing. However, VPW Studio can't
replace all the features of a GameShark, as it works on the ROM level, and
doesn't interact with the game while it's running. This means you should not
expect VPW Studio to let you create new match types or AI behavior, among other
things. Another key point is the term "change", as adding <em>new</em> items to
the game can require editing multiple sections, and is 99% likely to require
various pointers to be rewritten to point to new locations. That's even
<em>before</em> you account changing the game code to deal with file ID assumptions
(e.g. the games assume that the animation file IDs lie in certain ranges),
which are different per game, and not all the same, either. VPW Studio is not
equipped to handle this situation, which is better handled by a full disassembly
of the game(s).</p>

<p>Even with these limitations, it's possible to use VPW Studio (along with some
other tools) to create a ROM hack of AKI's wrestling games on Nintendo 64 that will
work on real hardware. In fact, VPW Studio largely owes its existence to the
<a href="https://vpw.ajworld.net/vpw2freem/">Virtual Pro-Wrestling 2 freem Edition</a>
hack, and vice versa.</p>

<h3>Supported Games</h3>
<p>Currently, only the AKI wrestling games on the Nintendo 64 are supported:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that not every game supports every portion of VPW Studio. Supported games
are listed in the specific sections for each tool.</p>

<p>Nintendo 64 games are relatively easier to edit and rebuild, being a single
ROM image. When it comes to hacking games on disc-based systems (e.g. PlayStation,
GameCube, XBox), extra challenges are added (such as building a proper disc image
so the game can run on real hardware).</p>

<p>Support for AKI's PS1 wrestling games (<em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling</em> and
<em>WCW vs. the World</em>) is not the primary focus at the moment, but small
steps are being taken towards supporting formats the PS1 games use. Adding
proper support for hacking the PS1 games in VPW Studio would require a number
of non-trivial UI changes, as well as Project File differences and various other
under-the-hood details that need changing. "Full" PS1 game editing support support
will rely on external tools, especially for video, music, and disc image creation.</p>

<p>Originally, support was also planned for the AKI-developed Def Jam games
(primarily <em>Def Jam Vendetta</em> and <em>Def Jam: Fight for NY</em>) after
adding support for the two PlayStation 1 games. As of August 2021, the Def Jam
games are officially out of scope for VPW Studio. A new, purpose-built tool
would be a better solution for the Def Jam games.</p>

<p>There will be no attempt to allow project building for prototype versions of
the games. This may or may not change in the future.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="Requirements">Requirements and Notes</a></h2>
<p>In order to use VPW Studio, you'll need a few things.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>.NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher.</li>
<li>Any of the above listed games in Z64 ROM format. No other N64 ROM formats are
supported at this time. Please convert non-Z64 format ROMs with a tool, such as
<a href="https://ucon64.sourceforge.io/">uCON64</a>, <a href="https://www.zophar.net/utilities/n64aud/tool-n64.html">Tool64</a>
(<a href="http://sheesh.us/mods/how-to-convert-any-n64-rom-to-z64-format-using-tool64/">instructions for Tool64</a>),
or <a href="https://hack64.net/tools/swapper.php">Hack64's online Web Swapper</a>.<br />
More information about <a href="http://n64dev.org/romformats.html">N64 ROM formats</a>
can be found on n64dev.org.</li>
<li>OpenGL 3.3 support (for <a href="#ModelTool2">ModelTool2</a> dialog and any other 3D-displaying stuff)</li>
<li>An image editor that can create and edit <em>paletted</em> PNG images. (Ideally, one that allows for exporting palettes in JASC Paint Shop Pro format.)</li>
<li>A hex editor, to do things that aren't (easily) possible in VPW Studio yet.
(If you don't already have a hex editor, <a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">HxD</a>
is recommended for Windows.)</li>
<li>A calculator that can work in hex and binary modes. Your operating system's calculator
may fit the bill (guaranteed on Windows, though you might need to switch to Programmer view).</li>
<li>Japanese IME/text entry, if you plan on editing Virtual Pro-Wrestling 64 or Virtual Pro-Wrestling 2.</li>
<li>Patience. (This program is not yet complete, and has a long way to go.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommended Extra Tools</h3>
<p>Aside from a hex editor, an image editor, and a hex-capable calculator, you'll
probably want some other tools on hand.</p>

<ul>
<li>A Nintendo 64 emulator, for testing builds of your projects. An emulator with debugging tools is highly recommended, and currently <em>required</em> for some changes.</li>
<li>A 3D modeler, for viewing models exported in Wavefront OBJ format. If you haven't already bought into a specific 3D editor ecosystem, <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> is free and supported on multiple platforms.
<ul><li>And if you decide to use Blender (v2.93), grab the <a href="https://github.com/ProWrestlingMods/AKI-Model-Blender-IO-Addon"><code>AkiModel</code> import/export plugins by Grix</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/queueRAM/Texture64">Texture64</a> by queueRAM &ndash; handles various Nintendo 64 texture formats.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jombo23/N64-Tools">N64 Midi Tool and N64 Sound Tool</a>, originally by SubDrag and Ice Mario. As the names suggest, these handle sequenced and streaming sounds.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AKI-Club/vpwspal/releases/tag/v1.1">VPW Studio Palette Tools</a>, for quickly converting and merging JASC PSP palette files to VPW Studio palette format. Binaries are included with VPW Studio in the "Tools" folder. They are command-line programs, so use the Command Prompt to launch them. Documentation for these tools can be found in the <a href="#ExtPalTools">External Tools</a> section of this manual.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>This program is currently a GIANT work in progress. Many features are not
implemented yet, various safeguards are not put in place, and so on.</li>
<li>Since the program is a work in progress, any and all VPW Studio-originated
file formats are subject to change. Don't get too attached to your projects.</li>
<li>Knowledge of hexadecimal is assumed.</li>
<li>Some general knowledge of at least one of the supported games is also assumed.</li>
<li>This program has not been tested on non-Windows OSes. Your mileage may vary.</li>
<li>Make sure to check the documentation of your emulator and/or flash cart for other
important information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Support (or lack thereof)</h3>
<p>This program is provided as-is, with no warranties or technical support given.</p>

<p>The program is primarily the work of one person, and they do not have the
capabilities to be both the primary developer <em>and</em> personal/private
technical support (without detriment to development time and/or developer sanity).</p>

<p>The few times I have tried to offer private one-on-one technical support,
I ended up getting angry at myself for not having enough patience to deal with
people. Therefore, <strong><em><big><big>I <small>(freem)</small> can not offer private one-on-one technical
support for VPW Studio. Please do not contact me directly for technical support.</big></big></em></strong>
This includes, but is not limited to, e-mails and direct/private messages. Yes,
I made the program, but that does not mean I have the time to solve everyone's
problems, nor do I have the patience to walk everyone through every possible
situation that could come up.</p>

<p>Since there is no "official" technical support channel, you will have to turn
to the community. Though a large number of gaming communities have abandoned web
forums as a communication/information source, the AKI hacking community has too much
of a history with them ("HACKERS CLUB", "The No Mercy Zone", JamStubbs' archive,
and many more) to just abandon them for the "fancy new thing". Or, to put it another
way, Discord didn't exist back in 2000, and ezBoard was a decent enough free forum
host, so we all just went with that. Fast forward two decades, and we're still
primarily using forums, because information rot is a very real problem.</p>

<p>With all of that said, here are some forums where you can ask for VPW Studio
technical support:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://oldskoolreunion.com/forum/">Old Skool Reunion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://akilive.boards.net/">AKI Live</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/vpw2dojo/">VPW2 Dojo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Posting your problems and questions in a public place has a few benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testers and other users of the program may have run into the same issue as you
(and can possibly help solve it).</li>
<li>People who have the same problem in the future can see your post, which hopefully
by then, has a solution as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3>"What about program bugs?"</h3>
<p>Any bugs with the program should be reported on the <a href="https://github.com/AKI-Club/VPWStudio/issues">GitHub
Issues page</a>. When filing a bug report, please make it a point to include
the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The version of VPW Studio being used (found in Help &rarr; About VPW Studio).</li>
<li>The game being edited, <strong><em>including region and revision information</em></strong> (important!! see also: <a href="#Region_GoodNames">region naming issues</a>)</li>
<li>What you're attempting to do (please provide as much detail as reasonably possible)</li>
<li>What you expect to happen</li>
<li>What actually happens</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if what you're trying to do worked in a previous version of VPW Studio,
please note that, along with the last known version where it worked.</p>

<p>You may be asked to provide an example project (and files) if the problem can
not be easily replicated by the development team. To prevent various issues on
all ends, please make a new project demonstrating the issue, and submit that
(along with any other relevant files) if requested. We do not want to be
responsible for anyone's project being "leaked" via bug reports.</p>

<p>Note: If VPW Studio tells you something is currently unimplemented, that is
not exactly a program bug. It's merely a reminder that the program is incomplete.
There is no need to report these items on the Issues page, unless there is no
"incomplete" message given when using them.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="MainInterface">Main Interface</a></h2>
<img src="./img/main_interface.png" title="Main Interface" />
<p>The main form appears when you boot VPW Studio. Most of the functionality
is disabled until a project file is opened or created, though there are a few tools
that don't require a project.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="ProgramOptions">Program Options</a></h2>
<p>VPW Studio has a small set of options, primarily targeted towards the building
and playing process. Select Tools &rarr; Program Options to open the dialog.</p>

<h3>N64 Emulator</h3>
<p>The "N64 Emulator" section of the Program Options dialog allows you to set up
an N64 emulator to use for testing the changed ROM.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Path</strong> &ndash; Path to the emulator executable file.</li>
<li><strong>Arguments</strong> &ndash; Any additional arguments to be passed to the emulator.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build</h3>
<p>The "Build" portion of the Program Options dialog currently only contains an
option to modify the verbosity of the build log. The default option is "Quiet"
(as of Pre-Alpha Preview 18).</p>

<p>Setting the Build Log Verbosity to "Quiet" can <strong>significantly</strong>
shorten build times, especially on older and/or slower computers. If you have
used VPW Studio before Pre-Alpha Preview 18 (v0.0.0.18), it is highly recommended
to change the Build Log Verbosity option to "Quiet".</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="ProjectFiles">Project Files</a></h2>
<p>VPW Studio operates on the concept of Project Files. A project file represents
a "total conversion" hack, as this is the primary project type created by the AKI
hacking community over the past two decades. Each project file currently targets a
single game version and region combination. Locations in the ROM can change between
regions and revisions, and certain versions of the games have more external
documentation than others.</p>

<p>Project Files have the extension <code>.vpwsproj</code>. Technical information
about the Project File format can be found in <a href="./appendix_b.html#ProjectFile">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>
<p>Aside from the Project File itself, the project expects a specific directory
structure for storing files. Upon saving a project for the first time, two
directories will be made in the location the project was saved:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Assets</strong> &ndash; Assets are the raw files that get converted
to various game formats. This is typically where your PNG textures live.</li>
<li><strong>ProjectFiles</strong> &ndash; Anything in the ProjectFiles directory
is meant to be ready to insert (i.e. already in formats the game is expecting).</li>
</ul>

<p>VPW Studio expects these directories to exist for any saved project. By default,
the program looks for the directories in the same directory as the Project File.
You can change their locations via the <a href="#ProjectProperties">Project
Properties</a> dialog.</p>

<h3>Creating a New Project</h3>
<p>Getting started with the main portion of the program requires creating a new project.
Select "New Project..." from the File menu, which will bring up the New Project dialog.</p>

<img src="./img/new_project.png" title="New Project Dialog" />

<p>The options presented are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Name</strong> &ndash; The name of this project.</li>
<li><strong>Author(s)</strong> &ndash; Names of people involved in the project. Optional, but recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Game Type</strong> &ndash; Select the game your project is based on. Be sure to match the proper region and revision.</li>
<li><strong>Base ROM File</strong> &ndash; Set the location of the base/input Z64 format ROM.</li>
<li><strong>Output ROM File</strong> &ndash; Set the location of the built/output Z64 format ROM. Defaults to <code>built.z64</code> in pre-Alpha Preview 28 and later.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Location File</strong> &ndash; When checked, allows you to use a
custom Location File. Helpful if you've already made changes to the base ROM that
result in differences from the default Location File for the specified Game Type.
<strong><em>Most people will not need to use this.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these may be changed later in the <a href="#ProjectProperties">Project
Properties</a> dialog. Upon pressing OK, you will be sent back to the main screen,
with the main form updating to reflect the new project.</p>

<p>After creating a new project, the first thing you should do is <a href="#Saving">save
it</a>. This is <strong>required</strong> for various functions of VPW Studio to work
correctly. Future versions of the program may force a save upon starting a new
project, but this is currently not implemented.</p>

<h4>Base ROM and Game Type</h4>
<p>The Base ROM must match the selected Game Type. VPW Studio checks a few
values to ensure the correct ROM has been selected: the two letter game code,
the region, and the version/revision value.</p>

<p>Each Nintendo 64 game is identified by a two letter game code (as a part
of a four letter product code). VPW Studio makes a cursory check to ensure
you're loading something that even remotely resembles the game you're trying
to edit. Unless you're intentionally trying to use the wrong ROM, you shouldn't
run into any issues here.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the two letter game code is often used
by emulators and flash carts to determine the save type, so modifying it is
<strong><em>not recommended</em></strong>. This goes quintuple for
<em>WWF No Mercy</em>, which is the only game in the series to save to Flash memory.</p>

<a name="Region_GoodNames" />
<p>For the region, it's important to note that the region codes used by
various popular ROM renaming tools/datfile providers <em>do not</em> match the
internal region codes used by Nintendo 64 games. A small conversion chart
is provided below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Region Name</th>
<th>TV Standard</th>
<th>N64 Region Code</th>
<th>GoodTools</th>
<th>No-Intro</th>
<th>TOSEC</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>North America</td>
<td>NTSC-U</td>
<td>E</td>
<td>U</td>
<td>USA</td>
<td>US</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Europe</td>
<td>PAL</td>
<td>P</td>
<td>E</td>
<td>Europe</td>
<td>EU</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Japan</td>
<td>NTSC-J</td>
<td>J</td>
<td>J</td>
<td>Japan</td>
<td>JP</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(Other regions and TV standards exist, but all six of the N64 games AKI
Corporation released only use these three regions, as far as we're aware.)</p>

<p>The game version/revision value is only relevant for two games, but since
data and code locations change between versions, it is important to specify and
use the correct revision. You should only run into this when editing <em>WWF
No Mercy</em> (all regions) and the NTSC-U version of <em>WCW vs. nWo World Tour</em>.</p>

<h3>Open an Existing Project</h3>
<p>To open a VPW Studio Project File, choose "Open Project..." from the File menu.
After selecting a project file, the program interface will update to reflect what
game is being edited.</p>

<h3><a name="Saving">Save, Save As</a></h3>
<p>When you want to save changes to a project, there are two options: "Save Project",
and "Save Project As". Both are available from the File menu.</p>

<h4>Save Project</h4>
<p>The first time you save a new project, the program will ask you for a location
and name to save the file. Upon doing so, two directories will be created in the
directory where the project file is saved: "Assets" and "ProjectFiles". "Assets"
is meant for unconverted items (such as <code>.png</code> images), while
"ProjectFiles" will store any files that are in game-native formats.</p>

<h4>Save Project As</h4>
<p>"Save Project As" is similar to saving normally, but it always asks for a filename
and <em><strong>doesn't</strong></em> automatically create the "Assets" and
"ProjectFiles" directories. Therefore, you should only use this option after
saving the project normally. This option is most useful when adapting the same
project for multiple input ROMs (e.g. different regions and/or revisions).</p>

<h3><a name="ProjectProperties">Project Properties</a></h3>
<p>If you need to edit any of the project's properties, you can do so from
Project &rarr; Project Properties. While some of these options are set from
creating a new project, others can only be changed in this dialog.</p>

<h4>Main Tab</h4>
<img src="./img/project_properties-main.png" title="Project Properties - Main Tab" />
<p>The options in this section are the same as the matching entries in the New Project
dialog.</p>

<h4>Output ROM</h4>
<img src="./img/project_properties-outputrom.png" title="Project Properties - Output ROM Tab" />
<ul>
<li><strong>Output ROM File</strong> &ndash; Set the location of the built Z64 format ROM.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Game Name</strong> &ndash; Set the internal game name. 20 characters maximum; anything shorter will be padded with spaces. (Japanese characters are converted to Shift-JIS encoding when building the project.)</li>
<li><strong>Product Region</strong> &ndash; Pick a pre-set region, or set a custom letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Internal Game Name is only meant to use a limited set of characters.
For non-Japanese games, this is a subset of ASCII, from character IDs
<code>0x20</code> to <code>0x7E</code> (inclusive). Some emulators will attempt
to use the Internal Game Name as the filename for any save data (e.g. SRAM, Flash,
Controller Pak). On some platforms, valid characters for the Internal Character
Name are not allowed in file names.</p>

<p>For Windows, the following "allowed" Internal Game Name characters
are not valid:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt; (less than, often used for redirecting input/output on the command line)</li>
<li>&gt; (greater than, often used for redirecting input/output on the command line)</li>
<li>: (colon, used for drive names in Windows)</li>
<li>" (double quote, which causes enough nightmares for programmers as is)</li>
<li>/ (forward slash, the default directory separator on most non-Windows platforms; often used as an "option switch" on Windows command line applications)</li>
<li>\ (backslash, the default directory separator on Windows)</li>
<li>| (vertical bar/pipe)</li>
<li>? (question mark, sometimes used as a wildcard character)</li>
<li>* (asterisk, often used as a wildcard character)</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these characters are used in your project's Internal Game Name,
you will likely run into issues when saving data.</p>

<h4>Project Files</h4>
<img src="./img/project_properties-projectfiles.png" title="Project Properties - Project Files Tab" />
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Files Path</strong> &ndash; Path to files that are already in game-native formats.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Files Path</strong> &ndash; Path to files that will be converted to game-native formats.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Location File</strong> &ndash; Path to a custom location file. Only useful if you're working from a ROM that has non-trivial code changes. <em>Most people will not need to use this.</em></li>
<li><strong>Wrestler Names File</strong> &ndash; Path to the Wrestler Name file for this project. (Currently unused/unimplemented; not particularly "needed" for No Mercy)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build ROM</h3>
<p>To build a ROM with the changes you've made, select "Build ROM" from the "Project"
menu (Keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>). This will bring up a build log window, which
provides updates on the build process.</p>

<p>Depending on the speed of your computer, the number of File Table entries being
modified, and the Build Log Verbosity setting, this process may be relatively short
(around 10 seconds) or long.</p>

<p>Currently, building the ROM will lock the UI thread, meaning the program will
look like it's frozen. Fear not, as it's still working in the background.
This will be changed in the future.</p>

<h3>Play ROM</h3>
<p>If you want to test the changes in an emulator, select "Play ROM" from the "Project"
menu (Keyboard shortcut: <kbd>F5</kbd>). If the changed ROM hasn't been built yet, it will build
the ROM before playing it. Otherwise, it will load the last built version of the ROM.</p>
<p>For this to work, you must set up the emulator details in the <a href="#ProgramOptions">Program Options</a> section.</p>

<h2><a name="WhichGameToHack">Which Game To Hack?</a></h2>
<p>If you are not already familiar with the capabilities of each of the supported
games, you may have trouble picking a base game to start your project. Some features
only exist in certain games, and if you are banking on the presence of one of those
features, you need to pick your game wisely.</p>

<p>The <a href="#GameSpecificDocs">Game-Specific documentation</a> can also give you
insights into what game to pick, as well as issues you might run into. It also
goes into more detail into some of the points mentioned below.</p>

<h3>WCW vs. nWo World Tour</h3>

inheriting (or possibly originating) a number of features from WrestleMania 2000.</p>
<ul>
<li>98 wrestler slots available.</li>
<li>Wrestler Edit mode ("full-featured") available.</li>
<li>Primary game save is on SRAM. Controller Pak saving is optional, used for custom belts and wrestlers.</li>
<li>Pre-match introduction sequence includes streamed theme songs (at higher quality than

how you dump the moveset data.</li>
<li>Five arenas available (one is unlockable). Arena data semi-known.</li>

</ul>

<h3>WWF No Mercy</h3>
<p>The last of AKI's six N64 wrestling games. Porting some content to and from
No Mercy is slightly harder, due to a number of internal changes made.</p>
<ul>

<li>Wrestler Edit mode ("full-featured") available.</li>
<li>Primary game save is on Flash. Controller Pak saving is optional, used for custom wrestlers.</li>
<li>The only game in the series where dropped weapons don't disappear and can be picked up.</li>
<li>Pre-match introduction sequence still includes Titantron "videos" and streamed theme songs,
along with the on-stage introduction portion. The in-ring section has been removed, though
it was included in earlier development versions of the game.</li>

<li>Combo fighting style not available.</li>
<li>Women available as first-class wrestler slots.</li>
<li>Moveset and Parameters formats are largely unknown. This is somewhat mitigated
by being able to create a character, then putting them in a match and dumping
their data.</li>
<li>Costume and body part models have been modified to make texture mapping easier.
Porting costume textures from previous games is harder, as a result.</li>

<h2><a name="CommonDataFormats">Common Data Formats</a></h2>
<p>When editing the AKI wrestling games, there are a number of common data formats
that appear throughout the series. The official names of most of these formats are
unknown, so VPW Studio attempts to give them reasonable names. Knowing about these
formats is essential for navigating the various entries in the <a href="#FileTable">File Table</a>.</p>

<p>This section only covers formats that are shared between multiple games (even
if implementation details may differ between games). For game-specific formats,
please see <a href="#GameSpecificDocs">the documentation for the corresponding game</a>.</p>

<p>If you are looking for specific format information (e.g. how the files are laid
out, binary-wise), please refer to <a href="./appendix_c.html">Appendix C</a>.</p>

<h3><code>AkiAnimation</code></h3>
<p><code>AkiAnimation</code> defines animation data, as you might expect from the name.
Animation data is largely the same across all 6 of AKI's N64 titles.</p>

<p>The format used for the PS1 games (<em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling</em> and <em>WCW vs.
the World</em>) has not been located or figured out. It does not appear to be standard
"TOD" format, as scanning the data files has produced 0 such animations.</p>

<p>Currently, there are no animation editing or creation facilities in VPW Studio.
Creating new animations from scratch (as opposed to splicing together existing
animations via GameShark codes) is still considered relatively "new" technology.</p>

<h3><code>AkiArchive</code></h3>
<p>An <code>AkiArchive</code> contains multiple files packed into a single File Table
entry. The game code is responsible for handling the data inside of the archive,
so it's tricky to provide automatic support. This file type first appeared in
<em>WCW/nWo Revenge</em>.</p>

<p>Zoinkity originally called these <code>TEXarchive</code>, since the examples he
found primarily contained TEX (<code>AkiTexture</code>) files. Further review has
shown that other file types can appear inside of these archives, hence the change
to a more generic name.</p>

<p>VPW Studio has read-only support for <code>AkiArchive</code> files, but there
are a number of corner cases that are not properly handled. There is also no error
handling for opening an entry as the wrong type, so be sure to view the target
file in the hex editor before attempting to view it as a specific type.</p>

<h3><code>AkiModel</code></h3>
<p><code>AkiModel</code> defines data for a single 3D mesh. This includes vertex
location, texture positioning (U/V) values, and three other values which either
mean "vertex color" or "normal vector", depending on certain header values.</p>

<p>Where possible, tools in VPW Studio allows for export to Wavefront OBJ
format, despite the fact that it does not officially support vertex colors.</p>

<p>Until recently (September 2021), there was no reasonably simple workflow for
importing models back into the game. The release of <a href="https://github.com/ProWrestlingMods/AKI-Model-Blender-IO-Addon"><code>AkiModel</code>
import/export plugins for Blender by Grix</a> has changed this situation significantly.</p>

<h3><code>AkiTexture</code></h3>
<p><code>AkiTexture</code> files start with the magic word "<code>TEX</code>",
and are typically used in the user interface. They are essentially a wrapper
around the CI4 and CI8 texture and palette formats.</p>

<p>VPW Studio can convert PNG images to <code>AkiTexture</code>, but they must have
a 16 or 256-color palette. Furthermore, images with transparency need to be
<a href="#DangerZone">manually converted</a> and <a href="#TexTransparency">modified
with a hex editor</a>, due to assumptions the .NET Framework makes about transparent images.
(Yes, it's possible to code around this, but until it gets implemented, you'll
have to follow the linked instructions.)</p>

<h3><code>AkiText</code></h3>
<p><code>AkiText</code> files contain multiple strings used for text display.</p>

<p>AkiText archives only appear in <em>WWF WrestleMania 2000</em>,
<em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling 2</em>, and <em>WWF No Mercy</em> (though the latter
game has moved away from <code>AkiText</code> for some purposes).</p>

<h3>Font-Related Formats</h3>
<p>The <code>AkiLargeFont</code>, <code>AkiSmallFont</code>, and <code>AkiFontChars</code>
formats are grouped together:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>AkiLargeFont</code> has characters that are 24 pixels wide.</li>
<li><code>AkiSmallFont</code> has characters that are 16 pixels wide.</li>
<li><code>AkiFontChars</code> defines what characters show up in the font.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each font glyph is defined as a 1bpp image. An <code>AkiFontChars</code> entry
may not always exist in the file table; it only seems to be used in certain games.</p>

<h3><code>MenuBackground</code></h3>
<p>A <code>MenuBackground</code> is a collection of unheadered <code>Ci4Palette</code>
and <code>Ci4Texture</code> data split up over multiple files, making up a 320x240
pixel background. Implementation details differ per game, though they only appear
in <em>WWF WrestleMania 2000</em> and later.</p>

<p>VPW Studio allows for "simple" import of new data for <code>MenuBackground</code>,
but it relies on the replacement PNG image being set <em>only</em> in the entry that
is marked <code>MenuBackground</code>, and not any entry after it. For more information,
see the <a href="#GameSpecificDocs">game-specific documentation</a> for the game you're
editing.</p>

<h3><code>Ci4Palette</code> and <code>Ci8Palette</code></h3>
<p>Nintendo 64-specific palette formats. A <code>Ci4Palette</code> normally contains
16 colors, and <code>Ci8Palette</code> contains 256 colors. AKI performs some trickery
when dealing with palettes, so this doesn't explain the full story.</p>

<p>For <code>Ci4Palette</code> data, multiple sets of 16-color palettes can be defined.
VPW Studio handles these extra color sets as "sub-palettes".</p>

<p>In <em>WWF No Mercy</em>, AKI pulled a similar trick with <code>Ci8Palette</code>
files, but <code>Ci8Palette</code> sub-palettes are not currently supported in
VPW Studio.</p>

<p>To facilitate user editing, <code>Ci4Palette</code> and <code>Ci8Palette</code>
data can be converted from other palette formats. The primary non-binary palette
format supported by VPW Studio (<code>.vpwspal</code>) is a modification of the
text-based JASC Paint Shop Pro palette format, allowing for sub-palettes and
transparent values. More information on this format can be found in
<a href="./appendix_b.html#VPWSPal">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<h3><code>Ci4Texture</code> and <code>Ci8Texture</code></h3>
<p>Nintendo 64-specific texture formats. Much like the corresponding palette types,
these can either use 16 (<code>Ci4Texture</code>/<code>Ci4Palette</code>) or 256
(<code>Ci8Texture</code>/<code>Ci8Palette</code>) colors. The textures usually don't
define a palette, so one must be loaded.</p>

<p>VPW Studio can convert PNG images to <code>Ci4Texture</code> and <code>Ci8Texture</code>,
but they must have a 16-color (for <code>Ci4Texture</code>) or 256-color (for <code>Ci8Texture</code>)
palette. Images with transparency do not need to be manually converted, but the matching
palette file must have the relevant colors marked as transparent. Some games even have
specific rules about palette indices, which can be found in the <a href="#GameSpecificDocs">game-specific documentation</a>.</p>

<h3><code>I4Texture</code></h3>
<p>Nintendo 64-specific "intensity" texture format. Allows for 16 steps of intensity.
There are other "intensity"-based texture formats used on the N64, but so far, only
the "I4" format has been found in AKI's games.</p>

<p>VPW Studio provides no support for converting images to <code>I4Texture</code>.
The current recommended workflow is to use Texture64 to save the I4 format texture
and import that data via the File Table.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="HackingWorkflow">Hacking Workflow</a></h2>
<p>VPW Studio's usage conventions are largely dictated by external factors.
Some of it is caused by VPW Studio being incomplete, while others are dictated
by the game's internals.</p>

<p>If you are planning to make changes to elements that are not editable in
VPW Studio, it is <strong>very important</strong> to understand the order of
events when "Build ROM" is called:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Base ROM</strong> &ndash; The Base ROM is the original ROM that will
be edited by VPW Studio. If you want your ROM changes to appear in the built/output
ROM, you <strong>MUST</strong> make the changes in the Base ROM. Any changes made to
the built/output ROM will disappear once you (re-)build the project in VPW Studio.<br />
You do not have to worry about the internal checksums of the Base ROM, as they are
re-calculated at the end of the build process.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Filetable Changes</strong> &ndash; Anything that appears before
the Filetable and its contents gets changed first. This includes Wrestlers, Stables,
Costumes, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Filetable Changes</strong> &ndash; Anything that involves the game's
internal Filetable (which contains a lot of things you'll want to edit) happens
next.</li>
<li><strong>Fix-ups</strong> &ndash; Changing the Filetable will cause the data
<em>after</em> the Filetable to be in unexpected positions. The fix-up phase does
what you would expect from its name: fix up any values that reference them.</li>
<li><strong>Checksums</strong> &ndash; N64 games have two internal checksums
that need to be validated. This step is where the proper checksum values are
calculated and placed in the built/output ROM.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main takeaway from this section: <strong>If you're going to make changes
that VPW Studio can't do</strong> (yet)<strong>, make them in the Base ROM.</strong></p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="TextureWorkflow">Texture and Palette Workflow</a></h2>
<p>(Notice: This section primarily deals with workflows targeting the Nintendo 64.
Information on targeting PlayStation 1 will be added once VPW Studio is capable
of handling it.)</p>

<p>Replace textures in a ROM hack-based project is different from using replacement
textures with emulator plugins. This is due to various techniques used by AKI
to handle costume layering and color changing. Each game handles these systems
slightly differently, and implementation-specific details are found in the
<a href="#GameSpecificDocs">game-specific documentation</a>. This section covers
general information applicable to multiple games.</p>

<p>The program you use to edit textures also matters. Most modern image editing
programs are focused on supporting 8bpp (bits per pixel) and higher color depths,
and are ill-suited to creating paletted textures. Some programs will claim to make
a 16 color (4bpp) paletted image, but actually store 256 colors in the palette,
making it an 8bpp image. Due to VPW Studio's current setup, it is <em>required</em>
to have proper 4bpp images when replacing a Ci4Texture. This may change in the future,
but results cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Programs known to properly support 16 color/4bpp textures, and the steps needed to create them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JASC Paint Shop Pro 7</strong> &ndash; Colors &rarr; Decrease Color Depth &rarr; 16 Colors (4 bit)</li>
<li><strong>GIMP</strong> &ndash; Image &rarr; Mode &rarr; Indexed; ensure "Generate optimum palette" is selected, set "Maximum number of colors" to 16.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are likely other programs that support proper 4bpp images, but these
are the two that have been tested with VPW Studio and known to work.</p>

<p>Do not save images using an "optimize" feature, as this may cause palette
order to be changed, resulting in textures that look wrong. The order of the
colors in the palette is <em>very important</em>, and should be the same between the
texture and corresponding palette file (if necessary).</p>

<h3><a name="TextureSources">Texture Sources</a></h3>
<p>Dumping the game's original textures using an emulator is often a starting point
for modders. If you attempt to do this with VPW Studio, however, you're going to
end up having a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>An emulator texture dump represents the FINAL result after running through all
the pre-processing steps (e.g. skin color, costume color, hair color, and so on).
When you use VPW Studio or do texture changes via ROM hacking, you're not working
from the final result, you're working from the composite parts that end up making
the final result. This means you'll have to get your textures and palettes from
VPW Studio, then work from there.</p>

<h3><a name="ColorFormat">Color Format</a></h3>
<p>The Nintendo 64 and PlayStation 1 both use a 16bpp color format for most
purposes. This gives a range of 0-31 for each of the red, green, and blue values,
which can be converted to 0-255 by multiplying the value by 8. It is important
to know this information when making textures and palettes, as some colors from
the 0-255 range can't be properly represented. Furthermore, it's imperative to
notice and merge perceptually similar colors when creating 16-color textures/palettes,
as palette space is limited.</p>

<p>For the Nintendo 64 games, a full black color (RGB 0,0,0) is often considered
transparent. To get a non-transparent black, use RGB 8,8,8.</p>

<h3><a name="PaletteFormats">Palette Formats</a></h3>
<p>Palettes come in many different formats, and it's important to understand
them if you plan on changing any graphical elements.</p>

<h4>Raw CI4/CI8 Palettes</h4>
<p>Raw CI palettes are the formats used by the game. They only contain the
available colors, and no headers or other information.</p>

<p>CI8 palettes have 256 colors, while CI4 palettes are meant to store
16 colors. However, you will often find CI4 palettes with more than 16 colors.
This is used for changing colors in Edit Mode, and is explained further below.</p>

<h4>VPW Studio Palette</h4>
<p>Even though there are many external palette formats available, none of the
existing solutions matched the desired criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text-based format (for easy editing outside of the program)</li>
<li>Ability to define the number of colors in the palette (16 or 256)</li>
<li>Ability to define the alpha/transparency on a per-palette entry level</li>
<li>Support for CI4 sub-palettes</li>
</ul>
<p>The existing palette format that came closest to these criteria was the
JASC Paint Shop Pro palette format, specifically from Paint Shop Pro 7.
Seeing as it was already text-based, it seemed reasonable to modify it for
the above purposes. VPW Studio palette files have the file extension <code>.vpwspal</code>.</p>

<p>More specific details about the VPW Studio Palette format can be found in
<a href="./appendix_b.html#VPWSPal">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<h4>Other Formats</h4>
<p>It feels a bit unreasonable for Paint Shop Pro 7 to be <em>required</em>
for palette work, so support for other palette formats is available. However,
the other formats are not guaranteed to support per-color transparency or
sub-palettes. Please see the <a href="#CIPaletteEdit">CI Palette Editor</a>
section for more detailed information on support for these types:</p>
<ul>
<li>JASC Paint Shop Pro <code>.pal</code> &ndash; the non-VPW Studio-specific version.</li>
<li>GIMP <code>.gpl</code> &ndash; palette format from The GIMP.<br />(For some reason, GIMP doesn't allow you to export this format directly from an image, necessitating the need for the next option in this list...)</li>
<li>GIMP <code>.txt</code> &ndash; text-based palette format from The GIMP.</li>
<li>Adobe <code>.act</code> &ndash; palette format from Adobe Photoshop.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unsupported Formats</h4>
<p>Other palette formats are currently unsupported. This includes the Microsoft
palette format, which unfortunately shares the <code>.pal</code> extension with
the JASC PSP format.</p>

<h3><a name="CostumeColorChanging">Costume Color Changing</a></h3>
<p>The ability for players to change the colors on costumes was first implemented
in <em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling 64</em>. The developers at AKI decided to use "pure"
red, green, and blue colors to signify different color-able parts of the texture.
By "pure" colors, we mean that the values for other channel components are set
to 0. All colors that are not related to costume color changing can be set as
you like (making sure they're not "pure" colors). The "pure" colors are then
replaced with the custom color by looking up the corresponding value in a palette
file.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the Common Data Formats section, a <code>Ci4Palette</code>
can have multiple "sub-palettes", and this is key to allowing the costume color
changing system to work (in all games after VPW64). The first 16 colors of a
costume texture's palette is dedicated to the colors you'd see if you set the
custom color to 0 (WM2K/VPW2/No Mercy). The colors used in the first set <em>do
not</em> need to be found in the custom color palette. The second set of 16 colors
should use the "pure" green and blue values that define the changeable colors.
(The handling of "pure" red values is game-specific.)</p>

<p>Some of the original textures in the games don't bother with a custom palette
in the first set, and just use the "pure" green/blue values in both the main and
sub-palettes. In this case, you will need to find the location of the default
custom colors for the costume item. This is somewhere in ROM, and is in a different
location for each game.</p>

<p>Mask editing, while using a similar system, is exclusive to <em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling
2</em>, and is explained in <a href="./vpw2.html">its game-specific documentation</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="SkinColorChanging">Skin Color Changing</a></h3>
<p>Even though you are not able to change the skin color of a wrestler in
<em>WCW/nWo Revenge</em> in-game, the costume textures take skin color into
account using the red channel.</p>

<p>Starting with <em>WWF WrestleMania 2000</em> and <em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling 2</em>,
you can customize the skin color of wrestlers. This is handled with multiple
CI4 sub-palettes.</p>

<p>In <em>WWF No Mercy</em>, each face has its own palette, which can be a pro
and a con for people who want to edit them. If you are working on a <em>No Mercy</em>
project, it is recommended to create a set of shared face palettes for most faces.</p>

<h3><a name="TextureLayering">Texture Layering</a></h3>
<p>Costume items are often layered on top of other textures. This includes
regular costume items, as well as various facial features (fringe hair,
facial hair, facepaint). In games before <em>WWF WrestleMania 2000</em>, this
was a non-issue, as all face and costume textures are pre-composed, and there
was no full-featured Edit Mode to allow for customization.</p>

<h4>Body</h4>
<p>The textures for the body are comprised of the skin, any tattoos, and the
costume items, generally displayed in that order.</p>

<h4>Face</h4>
<p>Faces are a bit more complex, with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The base face texture</li>
<li>Fringe/"front" hair</li>
<li>Facial hair</li>
<li>Facepaint and Accessories</li>
</ul>

<p>The ordering and location of these elements is not always obvious. For
example, accessories can be positioned over or under the facial and fringe
hair layers. Accessories can also wrap around the back of the head, requiring
an additional texture. The base vertical locations of facial hair can be set both
per-face and per-facial hair item.</p>

<h3><a name="TexTransparency"><code>AkiTexture</code> Transparency Fix</a></h3>
<p>Since the .NET Framework has issues with transparent PNG files (namely, assuming
they can't possibly be paletted), you have to manually fix the transparency in any
<code>AkiTexture</code> formatted texture. This involves changing a palette entry
to be transparent via a hex editor. Start by using the "PNG to AKI TEX" option in
the Tools menu. This will create a <code>.tex</code> file which can be edited.</p>

<p>TEX files start with 16 bytes of header data, which is followed by the palette
data (starting at file offset <code>0x10</code>). Each color takes up two bytes in
the palette. If it's a 16-color texture, there will be 32 bytes of palette data.
If it's a 256-color texture, there will be 512 bytes of palette data. The key to
transparency is the least significant bit of the <em>second</em> byte of a palette
entry. For example, non-transparent full black would have the hex values
<code>00 01</code>. To make this transparent, you would change it to <code>00 00</code>.
For other colors, it's best to throw the second byte into a hex-capable calculator,
then switch to binary mode and modify the least significant bit to be 0.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble determining which palette entry represents the color
that needs to be transparent, check the pixel data for the most common value.
In a 256-color picture, each byte represents a single color, which is simple
enough. For 16-color pictures, each byte represents two colors, packing the
color index into a "nibble". For example, a hex value of <code>23</code>
would draw two pixels using palette index 2 and 3.</p>

<p>After finishing the hex edit, be sure to set the Replacement File to the
new <code>.tex</code> file in the File Table dialog.</p>

<h3><a name="FontWorkflow">Fonts</a></h3>
<p>Both the Large and Small font types are 1bpp format. VPW Studio currently
has no workflow for handling font replacement, but they can be edited using a
program that understands 1bpp format tiles <em>and</em> has flexible display
options. <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/109/">Tile
Molester</a> is one such program.</p>

<p>While a complete guide to using Tile Molester is out of the scope of this
manual, the steps required to load and edit font data are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export the Font using the File Table editor. If the File Type has been set
correctly, this will export a <code>.smallfont</code> or <code>.largefont</code>
file.</li>
<li>Open the extracted file in Tile Molester.</li>
<li>View &rarr; Codec &rarr; 1bpp Planar</li>
<li>View &rarr; Mode &rarr; 2-Dimensional</li>
<li>Press the "Decrease Width" button (found on the top toolbar; an arrow pointing
left into three vertical lines) until you only see one "column" of the font data.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can start editing at this point, but the default colors are slightly odd,
so you may want to change them. Double click on each color swatch (between the large
arrow buttons) to set the color.</p>

<p>Do not edit the line of pixels separating each character. While the purpose of
this data is currently unknown, it is highly likely related to character rendering
and/or identification.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CodeDataPointers">Code, Data, and Pointers</a></h2>
<p>Having low level knowledge is not 100% required to get use out of VPW Studio,
but it is helpful to know how things work when making certain types of changes.</p>

<p>Games for the fifth generation of consoles (Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1, and
Saturn) load code into RAM and execute it. For the disc-based systems, this is
required, as accessing the disc constantly is bad for the lifespan of the
CD-ROM drive. <small>(Exceptions exist, but this isn't a manual for a Crash Bandicoot
editor.)</small> However, for the cartridge-based Nintendo 64, code execution in
RAM may seem like an odd choice.</p>

<p>Consoles from the fifth generation are not typically immediately able to
access anything at any time, as their available memory does not allow for
the maximum size of their storage medium. For CD-based games, you would need
at least 650 megabytes of RAM. For the Nintendo 64, you would need around
64 megabytes of RAM for the largest games. Therefore, games have to
specifically load what they need when they want to use it.</p>

<p>For AKI's Nintendo 64 games, the game code is generally split up into a
few sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global</strong>; code and data that's always loaded.</li>
<li><strong>"Cutscene"</strong> (e.g. game introduction and ending sequences, wrestler entrances)</li>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> (sometimes multiple segments)</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay</strong>; the code and data used during matches.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you might expect, the non-Global segments aren't loaded/run at the same time,
so they're not always in memory. This is why some GameShark codes have "activators"
to ensure the correct region of memory is loaded.</p>

<p>The game code needs access to data loaded into RAM, but it may not always be
in a static location. This is where "pointers" come in. A pointer is a value that
points to a location in memory. Pointers are used for both code and data locations.
Since code and data needs to be loaded into RAM, ROM locations may not always map
cleanly to RAM locations. Thus, some care is required when trying to edit pointers,
especially outside of the Global segment. It is also important to note that pointers
can be different between different regions and versions/revisions of a game.</p>

<p>Specific information on how each game handles this can be found in the
<a href="#GameSpecificDocs">Game-Specific Information</a> section.</p>

<img src="./img/filetable-main.png" title="File Table Editor - Main" />

<p>Double left clicking on a single File Table entry will attempt to preview
or edit the selected item. This does not always work, and you may be presented
with a Hex Viewer instead. The preview and/or editor dialog that comes up
depends on the entry's File Type. More information about these tools can be
found in the "<a href="#Editors">Viewers and Editors</a>" section of the manual.</p>

<p>Right clicking on a File Table entry will bring up a context menu with a few options:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Set Type</strong> &ndash; Change the File Type for the selected entry.
Available options depend on what game you're editing. Some common types are mentioned
in the <a href="#CommonDataFormats">Common Data Formats</a> section, and game-specific types are mentioned in
<a href="#GameSpecificDocs">game-specific documentation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Edit Information</strong> &ndash; Opens the <a href="#FileTableEntryInfo">File Table Entry Information dialog</a> for the selected entry.</li>
<li><strong>View Hex</strong> &rarr; <strong>ROM Data...</strong> &ndash; Opens a <a href="#HexViewer">Hex Viewer</a> with the selected entry's data in the base ROM.</li>
<li><strong>View Hex</strong> &rarr; <strong>ReplacementFile Data...</strong> &ndash; Opens a <a href="#HexViewer">Hex Viewer</a> with the replacement file's data.<br/>
NOTICE: This is how the file is stored on disk, and is not necessarily the format that will be written to ROM!</li>
<li><strong>Extract File</strong> &ndash; Extracts the selected entry to a file, decompressing it if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Extract Raw</strong> &ndash; Extracts the compressed version of the selected
entry without decompressing it. (Only available if "LZSS" is set to "True" for this entry.
<em>Most people will not need to use this.</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you right click on an entry that is set as <code>MenuBackground</code>, an
additional option, "MenuBackground Replacement..." will appear. This option converts
a 320x240 16-color PNG file into the requisite menu background files, and set the
relevant entries in the File Table. The output files are put in the ProjectFiles
directory, in a sub-directory called "Backgrounds". Each converted <code>MenuBackground</code>
creates a sub-directory based on the original PNG's filename, so be careful when
converting a background with the same file name as another <code>MenuBackground</code>
replacement.</p>

<h3>Navigation Menu</h3>
<p>The Navigation menu contains various functions to help you find entries in the File Table.</p>

<h4>Go To</h4>
<p>The "Go To" option (keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>) allows you to jump to a specific file number.
The value is in hexadecimal, so be aware of that.</p>

<h4>Search and Find Next</h4>
<p>You can search for a file based off of its comment text using the Search function
(keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>). Once a search has begun, you can use
"Find Next" (keyboard shortcut <kbd>F3</kbd>) to search for the next comment.
Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> while pressing <kbd>F3</kbd> moves backwards.</p>

<p>Note: Currently, the search can not be told to skip over item numbers. If you wish
to skip past a portion of the list, start a search, then scroll down and select
an item that is located past the area you wish to skip. Any further "Find Next"
commands issued will continue searching from the selected item.</p>

<h4>Search FileType</h4>
<p>You can also search for a specific FileType. Selecting this option brings up
a dialog with a list of possible FileTypes. Choose your desired FileType and
press OK. You can also use <kbd>F3</kbd> to continue the FileType search.</p>

<h3>Database Menu</h3>
<p>The Database menu only contains one option, but it's important if you've upgraded
to a new version of VPW Studio or updated the FileTableDB for the game you're editing.
"Reload File Table Database" will let you update your project's File Table with the
current data in the FileTableDB file for the current game. When selecting this option,
you will be asked if you want to overwrite any of your existing comments with the
comments in the FileTableDB.</p>

<h3>Export Menu</h3>
<p>The Export Menu is something most people won't ever need to touch, but it is
documented here anyways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Export Midwaydec File List...</strong> &ndash; Exports a file list for Midwaydec, a program by Zoinkity. (However, Zoinkity has declared Midwaydec "dead".)</li>
<li><strong>Export CSV...</strong> &ndash; Only of use for people dealing with disassemblies. Output is meant to target a tool that has yet to be written (by freem or anyone else).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="FileTableEntryInfo">File Table Entry Information</a></h2>
<p>There are two versions of the File Table Entry Information dialog, depending
on how many entries are selected.</p>

<h4>Single Entry</h4>
<img src="./img/filetable_entry_single-main.png" title="File Table Entry Information (single file selected) - Main" />

<p>The "Main" tab contains the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Type</strong> &ndash; File type for this entry. Like the context menu, the available options depend on the game being edited.</li>
<li><strong>Force File Type</strong> &ndash; If this box is checked, this entry has a different File Type than what's normally in the table. (This is only used to prevent freem from having to debug issues previewing things.)</li>
<li><strong>Comment</strong> &ndash; General comment for this entry. Typically filled out from the FileTableDB for the relevant game.</li>
<li><strong>Project-specific Comment</strong> &ndash; Project-specific comment for this entry. Useful for noting what you've changed something to.</li>
<li><strong>Replacement Encoding</strong> &ndash; Choose the encoding for this entry. Only the "Force" options work as intended. ("Pick Best" is meant to test both options and select the smallest one, but it's not implemented yet.)</li>
<li><strong>Replacement File Path</strong> &ndash; Path to the replacement file for this entry. You can use the "Browse" button to pick a file.</li>
</ul>

<img src="./img/filetable_entry_single-extra.png" title="File Table Entry Information (single file selected) - Extra" />
<p>The single entry dialog has an "Extra" tab, which includes a few options
for specific file types.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image Width</strong> &ndash; Set the width of an image. Primarily used with <code>I*Texture</code> and <code>RawCi*</code> types. "Unset" value is -1.</li>
<li><strong>Image Height</strong> &ndash; Set the height of an image. Primarily used with <code>I*Texture</code> and <code>RawCi*</code> types. "Unset" value is -1.</li>
<li><strong>Transparent Color Index</strong> &ndash; Currently unused. "Unset" value is -1.</li>
<li><strong>Default Palette ID</strong> &ndash; Set the default palette ID, used for
previewing images. The value corresponds to an index in the File Table, and is
hexadecimal. "Unset" value is <code>FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</code>, since File Table IDs
are unsigned.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal Mirroring</strong> &ndash; Force horizontal mirroring for a texture. Primarily used with <code>CI*Texture</code>s.</li>
<li><strong>Vertical Mirroring</strong> &ndash; Force vertical mirroring for a texture. Primarily used with <code>CI*Texture</code>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>These options are <em><strong>not</strong> disabled</em> based on the entry's file type, so be careful
when using them.</p>

<h4>Multiple Entries</h4>
<img src="./img/filetable_entry_multiple.png" title="File Table Entry Information (multiple files selected) - Main" />

<p>If multiple entries are selected, the multi-entry version of the dialog is displayed.
Each file table entry is given its own row in a grid, with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File ID</strong> &ndash; The index/ID of this file table entry. Read-only.</li>
<li><strong>File Type</strong> &ndash; File type for this entry. Like the context menu and single entry dialog, the available options depend on the game being edited.</li>
<li><strong>Encoding</strong> &ndash; (currently broken, don't touch it!)</li>
<li><strong>Comment</strong> &ndash; General comment for this entry. Typically filled out from the FileTableDB for the relevant game.</li>
<li><strong>Project-specific Comment</strong> &ndash; Project-specific comment for this entry. Useful for noting what you've changed something to.</li>
<li><strong>Replacement File</strong> &ndash; Path to the replacement file for this entry.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> &ndash; Browse for a replacement file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since various types of files can be selected, the contents of the "Extra" tab
from the single entry dialog do not appear here.</p>

<h2><a name="Editors">Viewers and Editors</a></h2>
<p>When double left clicking on a single entry in the <a href="#FileTable">File
Table editor</a>, VPW Studio will attempt to show an editor or previewing tool
for the file in question. This section covers the various tools available.</p>

<h3><a name="HexViewer">Hex Viewer</a></h3>
<img src="./img/hexviewer.png" title="Hex Viewer" />

<p>The Hex Viewer is used to display data for "Binary" file types, but it can also
be requested via the File Table context menu ("View Hex"). The data is read-only,
so an external hex editor must be used to make changes.</p>

<h3><a name="CIPaletteEdit">CI4/CI8 Palettes</a></h3>
<img src="./img/ci4palette_editor.png" title="Ci4Palette Editor" />&nbsp;
<img src="./img/ci8palette_editor.png" title="Ci8Palette Editor" />
<p>Target Filetypes: <code>Ci4Palette</code>, <code>Ci8Palette</code></p>

<p>The CI4 and CI8 Palette Editor allows you to view and change palette values.</p>

<p>Select the color to change using the Current Color drop-down box. Modify the
values using the Red, Green, and Blue numeric boxes on the upper right hand side.
You can also toggle the transparency of a color with the "Transparent" checkbox.</p>

<p>The Palette Set option is only available with CI4 palettes, and only usable if
the CI4 palette has any sub-palettes.</p>

<h4>Supported Palette Formats</h4>
<p>There are multiple palette formats available for import and export:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game-native formats, "CI4 Palette"/<code>.ci4pal</code> and "CI8 Palette"/<code>.ci8pal</code>. Supports sub-palettes and multiple transparent colors.</li>
<li>The text-based VPW Studio palette format/<code>.vpwspal</code> (recommended for editing). Supports sub-palettes and multiple transparent colors.</li>
<li>JASC Paint Shop Pro palette format/<code>.pal</code>. Does not support sub-palettes; each sub-palette must be manually imported/exported.</li>
<li>GIMP palette format/<code>.gpl</code>. Does not support sub-palettes; each sub-palette must be manually imported/exported.</li>
<li>GIMP text palette format/<code>.txt</code>. Does not support sub-palettes; each sub-palette must be manually imported/exported. Supports multiple transparent colors <em>for import only</em>.</li>
<li>Adobe palette format/<code>.act</code>. Does not support sub-palettes; each sub-palette must be manually imported/exported.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="CITexturePreview">CI4/CI8 Textures</a></h3>
<p>(todo: screenshots)</p>
<p>Target Filetypes: <code>Ci4Texture</code>, <code>Ci8Texture</code></p>

<p>CI4 and CI8 Textures use a similar viewer, with the ability to change what
palette is being used. <code>CI4Texture</code>s additionally support sub-palettes,
which are alternate sets of 16 colors.</p>

<h3><a name="I4TexturePreview">I4 Textures</a></h3>
<img src="./img/i4texture_preview.png" title="I4Texture Previewer" />
<p>Target Filetype: <code>I4Texture</code></p>

<p>The viewer for I4 textures is a bit more complicated than the CI4/CI8 texture
viewer, as I4 textures don't have a width or height set in the file. Unless the
file you're previewing has set up the required Extra Data values (see the "File
Table Entry Information" section), you'll need to play with the width and height
values to find the proper settings. Be sure to press the Redraw button to update
the image preview.</p>

<p>Right clicking on the image brings up a context menu with three options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save PNG</strong> &ndash; Exports the texture as a 32-bit (RGBA) PNG.</li>
<li><strong>Background Color</strong> &ndash; Change the background color. Useful for seeing things better.</li>
<li><strong>Foreground Color</strong> &ndash; Change the foreground/drawing color, which defaults to white.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="AKITexturePreview">"TEX" Textures</a></h3>
<p>(todo: screenshot?)</p>
<p>Target Filetype: <code>AkiTexture</code></p>

<p>A simple previewer for the "TEX"/AkiTexture format. Since this format is
a container for multiple image types, the available options are limited.</p>

<p>Scroll the mouse wheel to change the zoom level. Right clicking on the image
brings up a context menu with two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save PNG</strong> &ndash; Exports the texture as a 32-bit (RGBA) PNG.</li>
<li><strong>Background Color</strong> &ndash; Change the background color, useful for images with transparency.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <kbd>Esc</kbd> button can be used to close the TEX previewer, in case the size of
the loaded texture makes it hard to click on the close window button.</p>

<h3><a name="AKITextEdit">AKIText</a></h3>
<img src="./img/akitext.png" title="AKIText Editor" />
<p>Target Filetype: <code>AkiText</code></p>

<p>The AKIText editor is used for text archives. These archives were first used
<em>in WWF WrestleMania 2000</em>, and are also found in <em>Virtual Pro-Wrestling 2</em>
and <em>WWF No Mercy</em>.</p>

<h4>Import/Export</h4>
<p>There are two options for importing and exporting AKIText archives to/from
different formats:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tab-separated CSV</strong> &ndash; CSV format, using tabs instead of commas. Meant to be used with Zoinkity's toolset.</li>
<li><strong>akitext Tool Format</strong> &ndash; Format used by the <a href="https://github.com/AKI-Club/akitext"><code>akitext</code></a> command line tool.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Control Code Reference</h4>
<p>Pressing the <strong>Control Codes</strong> button shows a dialog box with the
various control codes (typically) available for text display. The list is replicated
below:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>@B</code> &ndash; Blue text color</li>
<li><code>@C</code> &ndash; Cyan text color</li>
<li><code>@D</code> &ndash; Default text color (usually white)</li>
<li><code>@G</code> &ndash; Green text color</li>
<li><code>@H</code> &ndash; Hidden costume item?</li>
<li><code>@h</code> &ndash; Hidden move item?</li>
<li><code>@K</code> &ndash; Black text color</li>
<li><code>@O</code> &ndash; Orange text color</li>
<li><code>@P</code> &ndash; Gray text color</li>
<li><code>@R</code> &ndash; Red text color</li>
<li><code>@W</code> &ndash; White text color</li>
<li><code>@Y</code> &ndash; Yellow text color</li>
<li><code>%###</code> &ndash; Short name of Wrestler with ID4 <code>0###</code></li>
<li><code>$0</code> &ndash; A Button</li>
<li><code>$1</code> &ndash; B Button</li>

<p>There are a few more values than the ones known here, but they have not been
properly documented yet. This primarily concerns the spacing values (codes starting with <code>#</code>).</p>

<h3><a name="ModelTool2">ModelTool2</a></h3>
<img src="./img/modeltool2.png" title="ModelTool2" />
<p>Target Filetype: <code>AkiModel</code></p>

<p>This is a very incomplete tool for dealing with 3D model data (File Type
<code>AkiModel</code>). Not to be confused with the <a href="#ModelTool">Model Tool</a>
found via Tools &rarr; Model Data. The end goal is to be a quick and dirty 3D model
previewer, so you don't need to export the model to figure out what it is.</p>

<p>The available menu items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Export Wavefront OBJ</strong> &ndash; Exports the model to Wavefront OBJ format, for importing into other tools.</li>
<li><strong>Texture</strong> &rarr; <strong>Load Texture</strong> &ndash; Brings up a texture selection dialog, further explained below.</li>
<li><strong>Texture</strong> &rarr; <strong>Texture Enabled</strong> &ndash; Enable/disable texture mapping. Only really works if a texture has been loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Texture</strong> &rarr; <strong>Horizontal Mirroring</strong> &ndash; Change the horizontal texture repeat style. Loading a Ci4/Ci8 texture can set this option as well, depending on the value in the texture header.</li>
<li><strong>Texture</strong> &rarr; <strong>Vertical Mirroring</strong> &ndash; Change the vertical texture repeat style. Loading a Ci4/Ci8 texture can set this option as well, depending on the value in the texture header.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Load Texture</h4>
<img src="./img/select_texture.png" title="ModelTool2's Texture Selection Dialog" />

<p>The "Load Texture" dialog does what it suggests, allowing you to choose
a texture to map to the model. The available choices depend on what's in the
File Table, so any texture file without a specific file type set won't show up
in here.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the replacement path is not checked for
the selected File Table entries, so it's currently not possible to preview your
custom textures with this tool.</p>

<p>The three Texture Type options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ci4Texture</strong> &ndash; 4bpp/16 color images</li>
<li><strong>Ci8Texture</strong> &ndash; 8bpp/256 color images</li>
<li><strong>AkiTexture</strong> &ndash; Typically used for user interface stuff, but provided here just in case.</li>
</ul>

<p>Texture File ID works for all modes, while Palette File ID can only be set
with Ci4Texture or Ci8Texture. Sub-palettes are not supported in this dialog.</p>

<h3><a name="AnimTest">AnimTest</a></h3>
<img src="./img/animtest.png" title="AnimTest Dialog" />
<p>Target Filetype: <code>AkiAnimation</code></p>

<p>"AnimTest" is a tool that breaks down animation data into separate frames
and components. As this tool is very early in development, it requires external
knowledge to understand the displayed data.</p>

<p>The "Copy Hex" option is meant to be used with S.K. Stylez's Animation Editor
spreadsheet. Paste it into cell D3 (main) or D43 (secondary).</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="GameIntro">Game Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Game Introduction dialog is a crude information viewer for mulitple
parts of the game's introduction sequence. Right now, this isn't really working
as an Editor, so all changes must be done to the base ROM in a hex editor.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="Tools">Tools</a></h2>
<p>VPW Studio also provides tools that aren't tied to the concept of Projects.
The tools in this section can be used without needing an open Project.</p>

<h3><a name="#ModelTool">Model Tool</a></h3>
<img src="./img/modeltool.png" title="The original Model Tool" />
<p>The original Model Tool (not to be confused with <a href="#ModelTool2">ModelTool2</a>)
was the first attempt at providing model data information. Unlike ModelTool2, it shows
the list of vertices and faces.</p>

<p>Much like ModelTool2, you can export the model to Wavefront OBJ format via the
"Export OBJ..." button.</p>

<h3><a name="PNGTools">PNG Conversion</a></h3>
<p>Though the preferred way to convert PNG files is to include them in the project,
sometimes you need to generate target files separately from the build process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PNG to AKI TEX</strong> &ndash; Converts a PNG to TEX format. PNG must be 16 or 256 colors.</li>
<li><strong>PNG to CI4Texture</strong> &ndash; Converts a PNG to CI4 format. PNG must be 16 colors.</li>
<li><strong>PNG to CI8Texture</strong> &ndash; Converts a PNG to CI8 format. PNG must be 256 colors.</li>
<li><strong>PNG to Menu Background</strong> &ndash; Converts a 320x240 PNG to binary menu background chunks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from needing to use "PNG to AKI TEX" to <a href="#TexTransparency">fix
transparency problems</a>, you will likely not need to use these tools.</p>

<p>(These items formerly appeared in the Danger Zone menu. They were moved out of
the Danger Zone menu in pre-Alpha Preview 23.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="DangerZone">Danger Zone</a></h2>
<p>The Danger Zone is a collection of tools that is not necessarily meant for
end users. These tools are typically rough and unfinished, and usually serve as
the base for the final, more polished features. Starting with pre-Alpha Preview
15, items are grouped by their general purpose.</p>

<h3>LZSS-related</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>lzss compress test</strong> &ndash; LZSS compress a file. File is exported as <code>(filename).lzss</code>.</li>
<li><strong>lzss decompress test</strong> &ndash; Decompress an LZSS file. File is exported as <code>(filename).bin</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Others</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>name encoder/decoder</strong> &ndash; Work in progress tool for encoding and decoding the name format used from <em>WCW vs. nWo World Tour</em> through <em>WWF WrestleMania 2000</em>.</li>
<li><strong>toki 1 test</strong> &ndash; View Toki1 info. Requires an open project.</li>
<li><strong>vpw2 face test</strong> &ndash; Attempts to render faces from VPW2 given specific values. Requires an open VPW2 project.</li>
<li><strong>stable parse test</strong> &ndash; Internal test of parsing the text StableDefinition format. Only properly handles VPW2 and No Mercy formats.</li>
<li><strong>rom slice test</strong> &ndash; Test the HexViewerManager by getting a specific slice of ROM data. Requires an open project.</li>
<li><strong>move damage test (WM2K/VPW2/No Mercy only)</strong> &ndash; Show move damage values. Requires an open WM2K/VPW2/No Mercy project.</li>
<li><strong>vpw2 text index tool</strong> &ndash; Convert from VPW2 text index values to location and index.</li>
<li><strong>tim test</strong> &ndash; Tests loading of TIM files (PlayStation textures) and their internal CLUT/palette values.</li>
<li><strong>test scene 3d</strong> &ndash; attempting to display multiple models at once. requires an open project file. incomplete and very awkward to use, only recommended for experts and
the terminally curious.</li>
<li><strong>param unpack test</strong> &ndash; attempt to test wrestler parameter unpacking. only works properly with vpw2 and wm2k; no mercy is "supported", but the output is wrong. all other N64 AKI games use unpacked parameters.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="chapterSplit" />
<div class="chapter">Chapter 3: "No, seriously, how do I..."</div>
<p>For various reasons, some common/expected tasks have non-obvious directions.
This section attempts to cover these tasks, as well as things that have been asked
for in the past, but are not possible with the program.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="MovesetParams">Edit Wrestler Movesets and Parameters</a></h2>
<p>Editing wrestler movesets and parameters is different per-game. It is easiest
to accomplish in the later three N64 games (<em>WWF WrestleMania 2000</em> and later),
but requires a small bit of work on your part.</p>

<p>The overall method is similar, but details differ per game:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create your character with the desired parameters and moveset in Edit Mode/Smackdown Mall.</li>
<li>Load a match with your CAW/edited character in the first slot (or wherever, or with multiple edits...)</li>
<li>Dump the moveset and parameters data from RAM into two separate files.</li>
<li>Replace the existing moveset and param files in the File Table with the newly dumped data.</li>
</ol>

<p>For Project64 v2.4 and later, ensure the debugger is enabled. If it's not
enabled, go to Options &rarr; Settings &rarr; Options and uncheck "Hide advanced
settings. Then, go to the Advanced section and make sure "Enable debugger" is
checked. This should enable the "Debugger" menu. While the game is loaded, select
Debugger &rarr; Memory &rarr; Dump, and a dialog should appear.</p>

<img src="./img/dumpmem_pj64.png" title="Project64 Dump Memory interface" />

<p>dump instructions</p>
<ul>
<li>Set "Start VAddress" to one of the values in the tables below, based on what you
want to dump. The beginning <code>0x</code> (as seen in the screenshot) is required.</li>
<li>"End VAddress" needs to be calculated based on what you're dumping. Take the base
value from the table, then add the data length to it. Using a hex-capable calculator
is highly recommended. Again, <code>0x</code> is required at the beginning of the address.</li>
<li>Ensure "Use alternate PC" is <em>unchecked</em>.</li>
<li>Set the filename based on what you're dumping (e.g. <code>wrestler_moves.bin</code>,
<code>wrestler_params.bin</code>). Using the "..." button next to the filename box
is recommended.</li>
<li>"Format" should be "RAW - Big Endian (N64)".</li>
</ul>

<h3>WCW/nWo Revenge and earlier</h3>
<p>Information on movesets and parameters in these games is scarce. RagDas and
Melonbread know something about them, but I haven't gotten around to actually
reading/taking in the information.</p>

<h3>WWF WrestleMania 2000</h3>
<p>Since <em>WrestleMania 2000</em> has multiple regional releases, the locations
you need to dump from will change based on which version you're using. The good
news is that Parameter data will always be 30 (<code>0x1E</code>) bytes, and
Moveset data will always* be 180 (<code>0xB4</code>) bytes.</p>

<p>* This exception is for RagDas; I don't have the necessary details offhand
for dealing with Combo or Shootfighting styles in WM2K.</p>

<h3>Virtual Pro-Wrestling 2</h3>
<p>VPW2 is trickier to deal with, due to having multiple Fighting Styles. The length
of the moveset data differs depending on the Fighting Style set in the Parameters.</p>

<p>Parameter data is 30 (<code>0x1E</code>) bytes long. As for movesets...</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrestling &ndash; 176 (<code>0xB0</code>) bytes</li>
<li>Combo &ndash; 180 (<code>0xB4</code>) bytes</li>
<li>Shootfighting &ndash; 126 (<code>0x7E</code>) bytes</li>

<h2><a name="NotPossible">(something that isn't possible with this program)</a></h2>
<p>Many requested things are not possible with VPW Studio. This is just a small
list of things I've seen requested over the past few decades, as well as reasons
why they can't be supported.</p>

<h3>Edit default wrestlers' movesets in-game</h3>
<p>One of the most often asked questions involves editing the movesets of default
wrestlers within the game itself. This is not possible because the default wrestler
movesets are NOT stored in the save data, and are always read from ROM. Making this
work requires a disassembly of the game, as well as finding or making space in the
save data for the default wrestlers' movesets.</p>

<h3>Add items instead of replacing them</h3>
<p>VPW Studio operates on replacing items, since there are multiple issues related
to adding files to the File Table. Some of these issues are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardcoded File IDs</strong> &ndash; Various places in the game code expect specific
File IDs. Adding or removing files from the File Table would require these
hardcoded IDs to be changed.</li>
<li><strong>File ID Assumptions</strong> &ndash; Following on the above, some parts
of the game code assume that certain files start at a specific ID. This is different
from the hardcoded IDs in that the game will treat the successive IDs as a sequence.
Some examples are: move animations, wrestler faces, facial hair, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Data Structures</strong> &ndash; Some data structures (e.g. wrestler movesets)
rely on specific data widths. Adding more selectable moves to certain slots would
require expanding the available list of moves, which is a non-trivial task.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also the matter of adding data that <em>isn't</em> editable in the
File Table, such as arena and wrestler definitions. These require a disassembly
to properly modify.</p>

<h2><a name="ExternalTools">External Tools</a></h2>
<p>Starting with Pre-Alpha Preview 24, VPW Studio includes some extra stand-alone
programs that are useful for development purposes. These programs are located in
the "Tools" directory.</p>

<h3><a name="ExtPalTools">VPW Studio Palette Conversion Tools</a></h3>
<p>Two stand-alone tools are provided for converting JASC Paint Shop Pro palette files
to the VPW Studio palette format (<code>.vpwspal</code>). These tools are meant to
be used from the Command Prompt, but file drag-and-drop works as well.</p>

<p>(For more information on these tools, see the original repository:
<a href="https://github.com/AKI-Club/vpwspal">https://github.com/AKI-Club/vpwspal</a>)</p>

<h4><code>vpwspalconv</code></h4>
<p><code>vpwspalconv</code> converts a single Paint Shop Pro palette to VPW Studio
format. All palette values are given an alpha value of 255, so you'll have to edit
the file if you need transparency for any color(s).</p>

<p>Usage: <code>vpwspalconv JASC_PAL_FILE</code></p>

<p>You can also drag and drop a single JASC <code>.pal</code> file onto the
<code>vpwspalconv</code> executable icon to convert a palette.</p>

<h4><code>vpwspalmerge</code></h4>
<p><code>vpwspalmerge</code> merges multiple <strong><em>16-color</em></strong>
Paint Shop Pro palettes into a single VPW Studio palette file, taking advantage
of sub-palettes.</p>

<p>Usage: <code>vpwspalmerge JASC_PAL_FILE1 JASC_PAL_FILE2 [...]</code></p>

<p>There must be at least two palette files passed in. If you need to convert
a single palette, use <code>vpwspalconv</code> instead.</p>

<p>The output <code>.vpwspal</code> file name depends on the first file passed
into the program.</p>

<p>Drag and drop functionality is also available for <code>vpwspalmerge</code>,
but you need to be careful when selecting multiple files to merge.</p>

<p>Sub-palette order is influenced by the order of the passed in filenames,
so remember to put the filenames in the proper order for output.</p>

<h2><a name="Glossary">Appendix A: Glossary</a></h2>
<p>Various communities create and use jargon to refer to ideas and concepts.
The Virtual Pro-Wrestling series hacking communities are no exception.
In addition, terms from other communities need to be borrowed or referenced
from time to time, and they may not be familiar to everyone. This even
extends to programs whose name and function are not immediately obvious.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Addy</dt>
<dd>Short for "address", as in "memory address".</dd>

<dt>BPP</dt>
<dd>Short for "bits per pixel", the number of bits required to represent
a single pixel in an image.</dd>

the N64. Also allows for loading games off of a CD-ROM. Origin of the V64 ROM format.</dd>

<dt>I4</dt>
<dd>16 value (4bpp) intensity texture format used on Nintendo 64.</dd>

<dt>ID2</dt>
<dd>One of the two ways of identifying a wrestler. This value is one byte
and controls indexing into various arrays and structures. ID2 values are
always given in hex.</dd>

<dt>ID4</dt>
<dd>One of the two ways of identifying a wrestler. This value is two bytes,
being used as a unique identifier (not necessarily matching the ID2 order).
ID4 values are always given in hex.</dd>

<dt>Midwaydec</dt>
<dd>A "dead" tool by Zoinkity that handles various N64 archive formats.</dd>

<dt>Mr. Backup Z64</dt>
<dd>Unofficial Nintendo 64 backup device that connects to the N64's cartridge
slot. Originally shipped with a Zip drive, but can be modified to use other
storage mediums. Origin of the Z64 ROM format.</dd>

<dt>Offsetter</dt>
<dd>Another Zoinkity-created tool for inserting files into a VPW2 ROM and fixing
the relevant offsets. VPW Studio largely owes its existence to this program,
particularly the File Table portion.</dd>

<dt>Pointer</dt>
<dd>A value that points to a specific location/address in memory.</dd>

<dt>TIM</dt>
<dd>PlayStation texture format.</dd>

<dt>Toki</dt>

<dd>Originally known as "Animation Stat Mods 1", the Toki 1 values control
a large number of parameters for moves.</dd>

<dt>Toki 2</dt>
<dd>Originally known as "Animation Stat Mods 2", the Toki 2 values control:
<ul>
<li>Player's "general" animation at the end of the previous animation.</li>
<li>Facing direction at the end of the animation.</li>
<li>Number of frames in the animation.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Toki 3</dt>
<dd>Toki 3 values are related to items in the File Table. Depending on who you ask,
they're either the file IDs themselves, or the location of the data in the ROM (relative
to the start location of the first file in the archive).</dd>
